'''Prox/i/fier''' is an addon to [[Tor]]. It will allow you to proxify any .exe you have. Sounds cool, amirite? Start Tor, then open this. Holy shit this is pretty neato right?
===How do I shot web===
Open Tor, then just go to options, then proxification rules, and add a program. If you don't want to use a Tor, you can just add a [[proxy]]. To do this go to Options, then proxy settings.
