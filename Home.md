The **[[Bibliotheca Anonoma]]** is a [[Git]]-based wiki designed to collect and safeguard the most important and interesting data from the internet, as well as make the best of it readable and accessible for netizens [[even while offline|BibAnon_SDK]].

## Intro

> *In the future, we will be remembered as those who protected free and universal access to our culture. We resisted and were rebels (according to the law of our times) and kept the copies of our culture: books, movies, music, all artâ€¦ we saved it, and kept it in a safe place, so that someday, the people may have access to it once again, free from the stingy hands of corporations.*

[[Recent events|SOPA]] have sparked discussion on the need to make a new internet, to defend from the evils of [[Copywrong]]. Despite all this talk, relatively little has been done on actually safeguarding the data that made the internet worth fighting for in the first place.

So, when we wondered, "what would we want to save from the internet if we had to start over from scratch, and how would we do it?", we designed this wiki to do just that. Currently, we've archived a small but wondrous number of books and stories that we've found interesting. This library will safeguard the works of our Golden Age through the dark years for a future that can truly accept it's importance.

Additionally, this wiki is based on [[Gollum|https://github.com/github/gollum/]], a DVCS-based wiki which allows users to check out a copy to read, edit, put on their server, or even make a fork. This way, if the main site goes down, anyone with a clone could just put it on their own server.

## Contribute

If you have anything that you believe needs to be saved, just follow these steps: 

1. Go to the sidebar 
1. Click on a category that your content fits under
1. Add a link to your content in that page
1. Click that link and start editing!

In order to make this project a success, we need lots of help. See [[Help]] to see what needs to be done.

Also, even with the ability to keep an independent local copy, Git is still heavily reliant on central servers. We need help building a [[Fully Decentralized Wiki]], and this will require development of [[Gittorrent]] or [[Hg-Freenet]].
