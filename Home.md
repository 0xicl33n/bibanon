## Welcome to the Bibliotheca Anonoma 

The [[bibanon|Bibliotheca Anonoma]] is designed to collect and safeguard the most important and interesting data from the internet, as well as make the best of it readable and accessible for netizens.

Recent events have sparked discussion on the dark future of the internet. We know very well that the internet is highly resilient to censorship and takedown, and much discussion has been made on creating another one if needed. Despite all this talk, relatively little has been done on actually safeguarding the data that made the internet worth fighting for in the first place.

So, when we wondered, "what would we want to save from the internet if we had to start over from scratch, and how would we do it?", we designed this wiki to do just that. Currently, we've archived a small but interesting number of books and stories that we've found interesting.

Additionally, this wiki is based on [ikiwiki](http://ikiwiki.info), a DVCS-based wiki which allows users to check out a copy to read, edit, put on their server, or even make a fork. This way, if the main site goes down, anyone with a clone could just put it on their own server.

Like the Carolingian monasteries in the Dark Ages of Europe, this library will safeguard the works of our Golden Age through the dark years for a future that can truly accept it's importance.

In order to make this project a success, we need lots of help. See [[help]] to see what needs to be done.

## What we have

### [[Bibliotheca Anonoma|bibanon]]

*Articles pretaining to how the Bibliotheca Anonoma works, the tools and scripts used, and possible modifications that can be made.*

* [[bibanon/Hosting]] - Want to host a mirror of the Bibliotheca Anonoma? Follow this guide and you'l have one up easily.
* [[Torrents|torrents]] - Local copies with magnet links to torrents that could be useful as sources for some of our books.

### Tools

*Stuff that we use to maintain the wiki. They need lots of work and attention.*

* [[Retext: Ikiwiki Mod|bibanon/tools/retext-ikiwiki]] - If you're running Windows, but still want to edit the wiki with a comfy GUI while offline, use this Markdown reader in conjuction with a git clone of the whole wiki.
* [[Mediawiki2Markdown|bibanon/tools/]] - Our crappy little Mediawiki converting scripts. It's not perfect, and it causes a few problems with links, but it's the only thing we got.

### [[Stories|story]]

* [[story/Damaged_Goods]] - What happens when Anonymous decides to grow a heart and help a literally broken girl smile again? This is the story of a registered male nurse who posted to 4chan about his newest patient, a triple amputee orphan. Believing that there was no way he could help her, he posted his story on /b/, hoping for some lulzy responses. But rather than tell him to rape the loli, Anonymous began to show empathy in epic proportions, pressing the man to give the girl a shoulder to cry on and possibly even adopt her.
* [[story/Blindmute_Loli]] - A spiritual sequel to Damaged Goods, Blindmute Loli is about an American everyman who finds his life turned upside down after he saves an orphan from the street. The injustice he suffers and the struggles he goes though just to see his adopted daugther will make you laugh, and will make you cry. Who knows if it's real or not, it's a good story nevertheless.
* [[story/The_Great_Scam]] - A tale of Nightfreeze's investment scam in EVE Online. It shows how such nice people could pull off something this evil, but more so of the immateriality of gaming.

### [[Collections|coll]]

* [[coll/Lulz_A_Corruption_of_LOL]] - A full soundtrack made by anons, for anons on the Insurgency_Wiki.
* [[coll/Copypasta]] - An archive of text that was so memetic, they were posted to 4chan multiple times. Sometimes it's awesome, other times shocking, but in the end it's something that just has to be saved. This archive was lost and rebuilt multiple times by various wikis, and as such needs a permanent home here.

### [[History|history]]

* [[history/4chan_History_Timeline]] - A nice, though somewhat incomplete timeline of how 4chan developed. Once posted on the first Wikichan, and rewritten by a random redditor, it was narrowly saved from being lost again with the second [[Wikichan|Wiki#Wikichan]] by AnonOps, and now resides here.

### [[Ideas|idea]]

* [[idea/Sandman]] Package Manager - A plan to implement the best features of Arch Linux's Pacman and AUR in all Linux operating systems, to make it easier to install and manage unpackaged source code.
* [[idea/Gittorrent]] - Put the DVCS of Git and the P2P download system of Bittorrent together, and we can make Git repositories truly distributed and independent from central servers. The possibilities of Gittorrent could forever change the way we develop projects and use software. This would be especially vital to this project.

## [[Websites|site]]

* [[site/Insurgency_Wiki]] - A wealth of information and guides to raiding built by Anonymous during the Golden Age and Chanology eras of [[site/4chan]]. Will be implemented into [[Encyclopedia_Anonoma|encanon]] and the Newfag's Guide to Anonymous.
* [[site/NC]] - Neglected Mario Characters, a popular webcomic in the ancient internet. It's a perfect example of what people in the past enjoyed, as well as the sad, crushing failure when the authors have to adapt to a new culture when they no longer have time to.

## [[Flash|flash]]

* [[Shoo, Fly!|flash/Shoo_Fly.swf]] - Slick comedy gold and a wonder of animation.
* [[RAGE|4chan/flash/V_rage.swf]] - A depiction of the events of 4chan's Civil War era: also known as /b/day. 
* [[4chan City|flash/4chan/4chan_City.swf]] - Showcased by moot at Otakon 2006. It's pretty cool.
* [[ScientoLOLjyuuichi|flash/4chan/scientolulz.swf]] - Actually, this was from Newgrounds, but it details pretty well what Scientology is about.

## What needs work (Under Construction)

### [[Books|book]]

* [[The_Newfag's_Guide_to_Anonymous|book/The_Newfags_Guide_to_Anonymous]] - Thinking about becoming a part of the legions of Anonymous? This guide will get you oriented fast.
* [[book/The_Big_Book_of_Anonymous_Recipes]] - A huge collection of tasty recipes, all well organized into a nice wikibook.
* [[Glossary]] - Words on the internet go out of fashion faster than US Presidents, so this little dictionary will keep this guide readable long after we've forgotten about Warren G. Harding.

### [[History|history]]

* [[history/4chan]] - The first, the largest, and the most influential English-language imageboard. It's the site that bore Anonymous. 4chan's unique culture has strongly infused itself into modern internet culture like Greece to Western Civilization.

## What we want (Under Construction)

### [[Books|book]]

* [[book/The_Return_of_the_Well_Cultured_Anonymous]] - A surprisingly good book on living life well. Was the life's work of the anons of [[Wikichan|Wiki#Wikichan]]. The whole book needs to be imported.

### [[Collections|coll]]

* [[coll/Information_Library]] - InformantB900's highly informative collection of images from 4chan. This collection attempts to turn the textual components into easily editable wiki pages.
* [[book/1000_Tutorials]] - 1000 Tutorials, spread by anons during Operation Payback. Contains a whole lot of useful info.
* [[coll/Flash]] - Various flash movies that are exemplar art pieces or historically important in some way. I'm telling you, they're pretty good.
* [[coll/Baww_Threads]] - An archive of text and pictures that are posted in 4chan's /B/aww Threads, where people come together to share the saddest things they know. Unsurprisingly, these stories end up being real tear-jerkers, and understandably, they're not archived very well.
* * [[coll/LP_Archive]] - The Let's Play archive. It's a collection of stories about Something Awful users revisiting games from their childhood and posting humorous commentary. The state of the website has not always been stable, we should save it here just in case.

### [[Stories|story]]

* [[story/Uncle_Anon]] - It's a sad, yet touching story of the forbidden fruit of incest. Some have called it the modern-day Lolita.

### [[History|history]]

* [[history/Something_Awful]] - The forum that gave 4chan it's culture and first colonists should not itself be forgotten.
* [[history/USENET]] - A special university-based BBS that had the option to be pseudo-anonymous.
* [[history/Digg]] - Before Reddit was big, there was Digg.
* [[history/Reddit]] - If 4chan is Greece, than Reddit is the Roman Empire. This powerful community is well-deserving of the title "Front Page of the Internet".
* [[history/The_Rise_of_Anonymous]] - Exactly how did Anonymous come about, and what can we learn about successful raids in the past? 

### [[Encyclopedia Anonoma|encanon]]

* [[encanon/Significant_Memes]] - A simple collection of articles describing all the memes that we held dear years ago and have forgotten today. It takes the descriptions of [[ED|encanon/Wiki#Encyclopedia_Dramatica]], [[LURKMOAR_Wiki]], and condenses the basics into something that will explain old memes to users easily.
