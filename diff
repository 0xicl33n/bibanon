-FAQ (in no particular order)
-
-Q: Can you help us?
-
-A: See http://www.anonops.ru/?id=contact or join irc.anonops.ru, join a channel and contact an operator. Or contact Anonymous on Twitter, Facebook.
-
-Q: Do you guys have a website?
-
-A: Nothing that's official. But most people end up on http://anonnews.org , or the IRC chat at http://www.anonops.ru
-
-Q: How do I know what's hot?
-
-A: Lurk in the IRC channels or go to http://www.anonnews.org
-
-Q: Is the news on Anonnews official?
-
-A: Well, in some way, it is official, on the other hand, it is „official“ and on the third hand the more people support an operation, the more official it becomes.
-
-Q: Why not attack that newspaper/TV/Radiostation?
-
-A: Anonymous does not attack media. Neither should you.
-
-Q: That is no media! It only spreads lies and propaganda! It is government owned!
-
-A: Freedom of speech counts for assholes too.
-
-Q: But, but. .
-
-A: As Evelyn Beatrice Hall said, „I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.“
-
-In the words of Noam Chomsky: „Either you believe in freedom of speech precisely for views you do not agree with, or you do not believe in freedom of speech at all.“
-
-Freedom of speech. Got it?
-
-Q: So, there are rules? WTF?!
-
-A: Yes, do not attack media and do not promote violence. Easy, eh?
-
-Q: What are DDoS and defacements good for anyway? It doesn't help the people.
-
-A: DDoS is all about steering media's attention towards the problems of the people. If media takes notice and spread the news, this will help the people. The fine art of defacing a website is about sending a message to the people and the owner of that website. Besides that Anonymous provides the people with information and guides and software to circumvent censorship, also know as „The Care Package“
-
-Q: What's in the [[Care Packages]]?
-
-A: Software like Tor Onion Router, a Circumventing Censorship Manual, more software, other guides and usefull stuff.
-
-Q: Can you give me a How-To about building botnets?
-
-A: Such how-to does not exist. Make your own.
-
-Q: I have seen this downloadlink in the channel, can I trust it?
-
-A: Only you can tell yourself who or what to trust. Generally, the download links in the topic are most trustworthy, the ones spread by operators second, and ones from random anons the least. Make sure to test any link or download you are going to use.
-
-Q: Some guy asked me in the IRC where I live and what my name is.
-
-A: Do NOT provide personal information in IRC. Instead contact an operator and tell him what happened. Same goes for other suspicious behaviour.
-
-Q: How can I join your club?
-
-A: Anonymous is not a club.
-
-Q: What is Anonymous?
-
-A: Anonymous is a very general movement. It is not a group with fixed members or rigid objectives. It is a fluid movement which anybody can become part of, simply by participating. To become part of 'Anonymous' all you have to do is join in with some of Anonymous' activities.
-
-Q: But how does that Anonymousthingy function anyways?
-
-A: Best way to find out is, to join a channel, lurk around and get an impression of it. Anyone who thinks that the freedom of speech is a remunerative goal can fly under the flag of Anonymous.
-
-Q: I am not a hacker, how can can I help you?
-
-A: By doing the following:
-
-* collecting/spreading information
-* organizing things
-* making contacts
-* providing insights
-* sharing experiences
-* pushing the IMMA FIRING MA LAZOR button
-* writing guides
-* translating
-* etc.
-
-Q: Is there a Hive???????????????????
-
-A:
-
-1. N00b, look at the topic by typing /topic
-2. Probably not, but you don't need a hive, you can fire manually, as you wish.

-
-Q: What's the target??????????????????????
-
-A: N00b, look at the topic by typing /topic
-
-Q: Is the target down????????????
-
-A: Go to www.watchmouse.com or isup.me and ask there.
-
-Q: Some guy keeps saying, there were danish girls in #channel.
-
-A: This is obviously a lie, there are no girls on the internet.
-
-Q: What is a netsplit?
-
-A: A netsplit is Internet-Darwin doing evolution.
-
-Q: Why can't I join the Anonymous' IRC when on Tor?
-
-A: Because of some vandalism *not looking at anyone*, Tor is not allowed on Anon's IRC chans anymore. You may use I2P instead, for help ask a bot named „muninn“. Muninn is the bot that the I2P-guys use to join Anonymous' IRC.
-
-Q: I am from the Media, how can I contact you?
-
-A: See http://www.anonops.ru/?id=contact or send an email to press@anonops.ru.
-
-Q: I am a Media-Women, how can I contact you?
-
-A: Please see http://www.anonops.ru/?id=contact or send an email and pics to press@anonops.ru.
-
-Q: Ok, I am from the media and need to talk to Anonymous' spokesperson/leader/strategist then.
-
-A: Anonymous has no leader, nor a spokesperson or strategist. Anyone who claims is no more qualified to speak about Anonymous than a random guy off the street.

-An Introductory Guide to Safety during Social Instability
-
-This needs to be merged into [[The Newfag's Guide to Anonymous]].
-
-## Based on:
-
-Anonymous – the uber-secret handbook: compiled by Anonymii
-
-Version 0.2.1, Date 09. April 2011 DRAFT VERSION
-
-## Foreword [fwd1]
-
-Political activists, dissidents, and even nonpartisan bystanders caught in social instability are often fearful for 
-their protection and protection of their families. Citizens may face harsh and even violent opposition by 
-authorities and security forces in such situations. This guide is designed to introduce the reader to the mentality 
-needed to stay safe during unrest and protests ­ both online and offline. It furthermore aims to assist in 
-continued communications during periods of internet and phone line restrictions.
-­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­
-## Introduction [idn3]
-
-The first section of this article will focus on personal safety. Personal safety can be spoken of in two different 
-spheres: Physical Safety and Internet Safety. It is important to remember that these two spheres overlap: a lapse 
-of internet safety could lead to physical identification. However, by keeping in mind a few important rules you 
-can drastically reduce the chance of being singled out and identified.
-
-The second section of this article will go into specifics regarding technology that can be used to communicate 
-anonymously, maintain secrecy, and protest effectively.
-

-­­
-## *** Personal Safety [prs4] ***
-
-### Physical Safety [phy5]
-
-The key to physical safety is to act normal so as not to draw undue attention to yourself and to not reveal identifying information to anyone. Important steps in achieving this can be separated into two lists: The Do List, and The Do Not List. These steps are especially important if you are an activist, as this puts you at more of a risk to start with.
-
-#### The Do List:
-
-* Blend in with crowds
-* Disperse into streams of people
-* Keep a low profile
-* Keep up to date on the news, especially protest rallying points and security checkpoints or roadblocks
-* Look for signs of plainclothes police in your presence
-* Cover anything that could be used to identify you such as tattoos or scars
-* If you come into contact with anonymous materials or protest guides, try to get them to protesters ­they contain key safety information.
-
-#### Additional Do's for Protesters:
-
-* Establish secure means to communicate with other protesters
-* Plan your protest point, escape plan, and regrouping point before attending a protest
-* Make backup plans ­ not just one, but many
-* Search for communications by Anonymous and Telecomix ­ read "Communications"
-* Try to obtain Anonymous' Riot Guide for homemade gas mask instructions, advanced coordination strategies, 
-etc.
-
-#### The Do Not List:
-
-* Do not trust anyone to be who they say they are
-* Do not give any personal information that could be used to identify you to anyone
-* Do not mention anything about relationships, family, or relatives
-* Do not mention ties to activist groups
-* Do not mention the group Anonymous to anyone you do not know
-* Do not mention anything about your past ­ education, employment, etc.
-­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­
-### Internet Safety [int6]
-
-Any use of the internet could potentially be used to physically locate you. It is important not to reveal 
-information on the internet. If you are doing anything controversial online ­ such as discussing protests or 
-blogging ­ you must be sure to conceal your IP
-. Please refer to the section on "Internet Security."
-
-#### The Do List
-
-* Keep in mind that any interaction you have online may be seen by others
-* Think about actions before you make them ­ do not say anything that you may regret, as it could be recorded
-* Create unique and secure usernames and passwords ­ Use letters, numbers, and special characters
-* Use a VPN if at all possible ­ see "Internet Security"
-* Delete your history, cookies, and cache after each internet session
-* Use Private Mode browsing whenever possible
-* Try using clients like Firefox instead of Internet Explorer
-* Use temporary or throw away e­mail accounts to create facebook accounts, etc. See [eml4]
-* Use Firefox plugins for added security. See [ffx5]
-
-#### The Do Not List
-
-* Do not use any or all of your actual name in account and usernames
-* Do not mention anything that could be personally identifying ­ see "Physical Safety" [phy5]
-* Do not mention time zones
-* Do not mention physical characteristics or abilities
-* Do not mention relationships, family, or relatives
-* Do not connect/disconnect from services such as Twitter and Facebook all at once ­ stagger your access so they can't be connected
-­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­
-## **Internet Security [isc7]**
-
-Each online device has an 'IP Address.' An IP can be used to help physically locate an individual. For this reason, 
-it is important to hide your IP. There are many ways of doing this. You should use as many layers of security as possible at any given time to increase your protection. Prepare internet security methods ahead of time in case internet restrictions are enforced suddenly. The three primary methods that will be discussed in this article are VPNs, I2P, and proxies.
-­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­
-### Virtual Private Networks [vpn8]
-
-A Virtual Private Network, or VPN, is a method of securing information communicated over the internet. When 
-choosing a VPN service, try to pick a service from a country that will not easily hand over your private 
-information. For example, services from Iceland or Sweden would be much safer than a service from the USA. 
-Also try to find a service that does not keep user logs or payment information [if using a paid service].

-### I2P [i2p9]
-
-I2P is an anonymizing network that supports many secure applications. We recommend using pchat to connect to 
-anonops.ru and joining channels such as #anonops and #oplibya .
-
-#### I2P Websites
-
-* <http://geti2p.net>
-* <http://i2p2.de>
-* [I2P Tutorial for Windows Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5J3nh1DoRMw)
-* [I2P Tutorial for Linux Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeRN2G9VW5E)
-
-#### Active I2P sites
-
-* <http://inr.i2p>
-* [I2P Port Usage](http://www.i2p2.de/faq#ports)
-* See also your router's configuration.
-
-#### I2P Installation and Running on Linux
-
-* Download and extract the installation files, no need for separate install (such as apt­get install). 
-* Run the router from /i2p folder with <tt>sudo sh i2prouter start</tt>. In seconds, I2P should open a 
-Konqueror­browser page of I2P­main console. 
-* Configure your bandwith settings. You might also consider opening some ports on your firewall for optimising the use of your bandwith.
-
-#### Portable I2P (Windows Only)
-
-* <http://portable­i2p.blogspot.com> - Contains I2P, several plugins, preconfigured browser, preconfigured IRC client and messenger. ­Before you can use anything on I2P, you have to start the I2P router from the portableapps tray icon­menu with the button _I2P Launcher_.
-
-#### Anonymous surfing with I2P
-
-* Go to your browser options or preferences (depending on your browser) ­> ''network/connection settings''
-* Select ''manual proxy configuration''
-* In ''http'' insert 127.0.0.1 , for ''port'' insert 4444
-* In ''https'' insert 127.0.0.1 , for ''port'' insert 4445
-Make sure that you have No Proxy set for ''localhost, 127.0.0.1'' so you'll be able to reach your I2P configuration 
-page. To test your anonymity, go eg. to: cmyip.com.
-­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­
-### Proxies [prx0]
-
-Proxies are intermediary connections that may help hide your IP.  They do not encrypt data. They may also help in accessing restricted web sites. Use them with VPN services to increase VPN security. See the following sites and [tor2]:
-
-* http://www.freeproxies.org
-* http://www.socks24.org
-* http://www.samair.ru/proxy
-­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­
-### Tor Onion Router [tor1]
-
-Tor is a proxy network that helps hide your IP
-. It does NOT encrypt data. There have been some claims of specific 
-countries [such as Iran] circumventing Tor protection.
-
-#### Download Tor
-
-* https://www.torproject.org
-
-Download TorButton for Firefox (Enable / Disable the Tor on the Browser)

-## *** Communications [cmm2] ***
-
-Anonymous encourages citizens of protesting countries to ask for assistance. This is best done using IRC to 
-connect to #anonops. Please remember that it is safest to use a VPN [vpn8] or I2P [i2p9]. The IRC can be joined 
-through a link at anonops.ru .
-In the event of an internet shutdown, you can be sure that Anonymous and Telecomix will be trying diligently to 
-restore communications. There are a number of things you can do to help.
-
-* Try connecting to the internet at various locations ­ sometimes only certain ISPs shutdown while others remain 
-operational
-* Try using dial­up connections if possible
-* Find ham radio owners and scan for communications by groups such as Telecomix ­ they may be able to provide 
-you with directions for alternative internet connection methods.
-* Locate universities and businesses with fax machines ­ we often try to use these machines as one­way 
-communication devices to provide updates, safety guides, and inspirational material.

-Basic rule: Security is a continuing process, not a state. Do audits on a regular and scheduled basis. And do encrypted backups. Backups are important, as there are two types of people, those who have backups and those who have lost their data.
-
-## Protips
-
-* use the operating system you are familiar with (Linux and Unix are better though, way easier to secure)
-* uninstall everything you not need
-* disable all remote tools
-* shred or encrypt /temp, /var/temp and all world-readable files
-* Encrypt your hard disk (Truecrypt : www.truecrypt.org)
-* Debian and other linux distros offer to encrypt the harddrive during installation. Use it.
-* Use a distro that boots from DVD/CD/USB
-* Never ever keep logs
-* Shutdown all unneeded services
-* Use a firewall
-* Use random password generators (KeePassX is a great tool for keeping such passwords somewhere safe)
-
-* Public access points are perfect - just about. (correlating logins with CCTV could prove disastrous so security cameras should be avoided while using such 'free' services. Cyber cafés, Mc Donalds, and many companies offer Free internet access, remember though, not to surf those nets without a VPN and/or Tor.
-* Keep private keys (pgp/gnupgp) in a removable device, and that removable device away from curious eyes. Encrypt the private key before doing this.
-* Keep VPN certs away from curious eyes via removable device, or common hidden folders.
-* Never use the same users/passwords on reinstall. Take the time to create a new one each time. Use password generators.
-* BE paranoid. All rare activity in your computer must be checked and monitored. That will provide 2 things: knowledge once you identify it, and added safety. 
-
-## Detecting potentially security flaws on Linux
-
-But be careful, if you don't know how to read Lynis' output, you'll become paranoid deluxe.

-* http://www.rootkit.nl/projects/lynis.html
-
-Scanner for rootkits, backdoors and local exploits on *Nix
-
-Again, if you don't know how to read Rootkit Hunters output, you'll get paranoid.
-
-* http://www.rootkit.nl/projects/rootkit_hunter.html
-
-## Destroying data securely
-
-### Unix/Linux
-
-To securely destroy data under *Nix you have some possibillities. The command shred -u overwrites
-
-singe files and deletes them finally, with wipe -rcf you overwrite and delete directories. Be carefull
-
-because the shredded/wiped data cannot be recovered.
-
-Open a Terminal and type
-
-    shred -u <filename>
-    wipe -rcf <directory>
-
-If you feel the need to wipe the whole harddrive, the command is as follows for IDE-HDs (/dev/hda is the first HD)
-
-    wipe -kq /dev/hda
-
-For SATA and SCSI HDs you type (/dev/sda ist the first HD)
-
-    wipe -kq /dev/sda
-
-If wipe is not available to you, you can use dd. (again the first HD)
-
-    dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda
-    dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/hda
-
-Use *both* commands, one after the other, if especially paranoid. Use them multiple times.

-Basic rule: Blend in with the crowd, disperse into the stream. Keep a low profile. Don't try to be special.
-
-Remember, when in Rome, do as Romans do. Don't try to be a smart ass. FEDs are many, Anonymous is Legion, but you are only one. There are no old heros, there are only young heros and dead heros.
-
-Do not give any personal information on the IRC chat as it is public, you mom could read what you write there and so could the Police. And don't mention your involvement with Anonymous in your real life.
-
-## Tips
-
-* do not include personal information in your screen name
-* don't discuss personal information, your address or where you're from
-* don't mention your gender, tattoos, scars, piercings, bodymodifications,
-* over-/underweight, physical or psychological (in)abillities (got the idea?)
-* don't mention your profession or hobbies
-* don't mention whether you're in a relationship
-* don't mention your involvement with other activist groups
-* don't mention any musical tastes/preferred literature/films, they're a good way to know someone
-* don't use special characters, that are existent only in your language. They would reveal where you are from
-* don't give even bogus info. Lot's of no's, make a yes.
-* Everything is completely seperate between your real life and online life(s), don't blend anything from your real life with anon, don't talk about Anon in real life except posting posters anonymously, etc
-* don't mention congresses that you have been at
-* don't mention your school, university etc.
-* don't mention what time it is where you live, mentioning the time can reveal  where you live
-* Never connect at same time. Try to alternate.
-* Do not post on the public net while you are in the IRC, and definitely do not mention that you are posting something on Twitter. This is easy to correlate.
-* Don't discuss whether you personally are DDOSing or writing How-Tos or Nmap'ing the target, making graphics etc. or not, just discuss general strategy
-* Do not post pictures hosted on Facebook. The filename contains your profile ID.
-* Stagger your login & log out times on FaceBook, Twitter & IRC. They can be compared for user info.

-Guide to Safety in Street Confrontations
-
-compiled from: http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/2/3/941050/-Guide-to-Safety-and-Victory-in-Street-Confrontations-UPDATE
-
-The tips below are provided by veterans of street battles within various contexts. Everyone who seeks to
-
-use them should try to bring as many of the described materials as possible in order to provide extras to
-
-others. But don't carry too much, as it will make it harder to move quickly when quick movements may be
-
-required. Remember: When you record and document, you allow the world to watch, and to act; bring
-
-more than one recording device and keep one concealed if possible, and in such a way that you may set it
-
-to record without it being known.
-
-Remember, the carrying capacity of the group also counts. Distribute supplies as per your group strategy
-
-and do so as evenly as possible among protestors.
-
-
-
-Protection & Safety
-
-Head
-
-Bicycle helmets provide good protection. Those designed for down-hill racing provide full-face
-
-cover and are the most secure. Construction helmets (hard hats) will also help protect the head, and
-
-are as widely available as bicycle helmets.
-
-A towel or thick cloth wrapped around the head can provide some protection, but is not optimal. It
-
-can then be covered with a metal bowl or pot for more protection but it is important that you are
-
-still able to see.
-
-Remember: The momentum shock to the head can still cause internal injuries, even if the outside
-
-of the head appears uninjured. Don’t wear things which can easily be grabbed (such as dangly
-
-earrings or other jewelry).
-
-Face Masks make it difficult to identify individuals, and if everyone wears masks none will stand out.
-
-Hoods will cover most of your face and baseball caps protect you from most cameras mounted
-
-above. Some of the best masks are t-shirts. Put your head in a shirt, use the neck hole for the
-
-eyeholes and tie the sleeves around the back of your head
-
-The best protection against chemical weapons is a gas mask. Any kind of mask should be tried on
-
-and sized before you’re in the streets fumbling with unfamiliar straps. When paired with goggles,
-
-respirators make an excellent alternative to gas masks. It is necessary to do some homework
-
-beforehand and find goggles that are shatterproof, don’t fog up, and that fit tightly on your face
-
-with the respirator. Respirators may be available at safety supply or welding supply vendors. Ask for
-
-filters for particulates and organic chemicals and tell the clerk what you’re filtering to double check.
-
-
-
-A bandanna soaked in water or vinegar and tied tightly around the nose and mouth is a last resort.
-
-It is far better than nothing, but remember that it is merely a barrier and not a filter and so won’t do
-
-much for long-term protection. You can keep it soaking in a plastic bag until ready to use. Bring
-
-several, as multiple uses will render a bandanna as gassy as the air around you.
-
-For protecting your eyes, swim goggles work well as they have a tight seal. Shatter resistance is very
-
-important (a rubber bullet to the eye can be disastrous). Most goggles have air holes to prevent
-
-fogging—fill these with epoxy. Covering these holes with duct tape can work in a pinch against an
-
-initial attack, though not for long term protection. Try them on with your respirator or bandanna to
-
-ensure that they are compatible and that both will provide a tight seal.
-
-Don’t wear contact lenses, which can trap irritating chemicals underneath.
-
-Clothing
-
-Wear thick clothes if you will be in range of rocks or other objects being thrown. Multiple layers
-
-may help protect against broken bones or other severe injuries. Wear heavy-duty gloves if you plan
-
-to handle hot tear gas canisters, fresh clothes in plastic bag (in case yours get contaminated by
-
-chemical weapons)
-
-Shoes These should be relatively sturdy, but still comfortable to run in, and non slippery, and, if possible,
-
-resistant to chemicals. Dont wear anything that may slip off, make sure laces are double knotted,
-
-etc.
-
-
-
-Skin
-
-Avoid use of petroleum jelly, mineral oil, oil-based sunscreen, lotions, moisturizers, or detergents on
-
-skin because they can trap chemicals and thereby prolong exposure. Wash your clothes, your hair
-
-and your skin beforehand in a detergent-free soap. We recommend using a water or alcohol- based
-
-sunscreen (rather than oilbased). If your choice is between oilbased or nothing, we advocate using
-
-the sunscreen. Getting pepper sprayed on top of a sunburn is not fun. We also recommend
-
-minimizing skin exposure by covering up as much as possible.
-
-Arms
-
-Something to protect forearms with as these are a natural guard to cover face/head. Chin guards or
-
-rolled up news papers are good alternatives. Foam plastic is a handy and light-to-carry protection
-
-against all kinds of blows. Chairs, and folding step ladders also work as personal protection.
-
-Supplies
-
-Keep blankets and water on hand to be used together in case of a person on fire. Use a wet blanket
-
-to put out the fire. Do not try to use water to put petroleum (gasoline) fires out. Even a simple first-aid kit can prove very helpful in unpredictable circumstances (see below).
-
-Safety in numbers
-
-Remain alert and aware of your safety and the safety of people around you.
-
-Remember you must try to avoid violence to protect the legitimacy of your movement.
-
-
-
-Food
-
-Avoid heavy protein intake during active times. It is difficult to digest and will slow you down.
-
-Carbohydrates are recommended to keep your body in energy. Banana's are good. Sugar is a quick
-
-remedy in situations of energy lack, but it can cause your blood sugar level to drop rapidly later on.
-
-Take care of drinking enough. At downtime, when you will have a few hours to rest, try if you can
-
-to eat a healthy balanced meal, and get some rest.

-For the eyes
-
-We recommend a solution of half liquid antacid (like Maalox) and half water. A spray bottle is ideal
-
-but a bottle that has a squirt cap works as well. Always irrigate from the inside corner of the eye
-
-towards the outside, with head tilted back and slightly towards the side being rinsed. It seems from
-
-our trials that it needs to get into the eye to help. This means that if the sprayed person says
-
-it’s
-
-okay you should try to open their eye for them. They most likely won’t be able/willing to open it
-
-themselves, and opening will cause a temporary increase in pain, but the solution does help. It works
-
-great as a mouth rinse too.
-
-
-
-For the skin
-
-We recommend canola oil followed by alcohol. Carefully avoiding the eyes, vigorously wipe the skin
-
-that was exposed to the chemical with a rag or gauze sponge saturated with canola oil. Follow this
-
-immediately with a rubbing of alcohol. Remember that alcohol in the eyes hurts A LOT. Anyone
-
-whose eyes you get alcohol in will not be your friend.
-
-Secondary treatments can include
-
-spitting, blowing your nose, coughing up mucous (you don’t want to swallow these chemicals!),
-
-walking around with your arms outstretched, removing contaminated clothing, and taking a cool
-
-shower. In fact, it is essential to shower and wash your clothes (this time in real detergents) as soon
-
-as you are able. This shit is toxic, and will continually contaminate you and everyone around you
-
-until you get rid of it. Until then, try not to touch your eyes or your face, or other people, furniture,
-
-carpets etc. to avoid further contamination. Remember, it is only temporary, and we are extremely
-
-strong.
-
-
-
-Staying Safe & Sensible in an Action
-
-A demonstration where police might attack requires a higher level of tactical awareness than your run-of-the-mill picket. Here are some generally applicable suggestions to help you stay safe and effective in the
-
-streets.
-
-Always have a safe space in mind. All demonstrators need to be aware of a safe place to get to if a
-
-situation grows out of hand. You define “safe” and “unsafe” for yourself. For some, safe is among the locked
-
-arms of fellow activists, right on the front lines; but there’s no shame in a lower threshold, for any number
-
-of reasons. Safe spaces change depending on movement and barriers by other demonstrators and the
-
-police, etc. In some cases they include wide open spaces or public areas. Other times they may take the
-
-form of an alleyway or similar hiding spot. There’s no hard and fast rule about finding a safe space, but the
-
-time to have one in mind is before the shit hits the fan.
-
-Always have an exit in mind. Assess how to leave a bad situation. Maybe it is best to be in a large group
-
-for protection. But if the police are herding you like cattle, then the large crowd is their focus and you may
-
-need to break up and leave in small groups. Getting away one moment might be your only chance to be
-
-active the next. Arrange with your buddies how to leave, and how to re-connect if you get separated.
-
-Use the buddy system and move in a group. If at all possible, make sure to have a partner you can trust, to
-
-whom you will always stay close. That way, at least one person always knows your whereabouts and
-
-condition. Working in small groups of people, all of whom you know well and trust with your own safety,
-
-is another important factor. Even if you are not part of an organized group with a plan of action, it is
-
-helpful to at least be with folks you can rely on.
-
-
-
-Be aware of crowd dynamics and dangers. You need to know what is going on - not just in view, but
-
-around the corners and a few blocks away. Pay attention to the mood of the crowd and the police. Certain
-
-actions like property destruction and violence will likely be caused by or result in violent behavior on the
-
-part of police. Be aware of police movement and different groups of protestors entering or leaving an area.
-
-Try to monitor the vibes and focuses of friends and foes at all times.
-
-Know what is going on out of view by regularly sending out scouts to investigate what the police and
-
-other demonstrators are up to. Since the situation at a dynamic protest will change frequently and rapidly,
-
-scouts need to check around and report back often. It’s a good idea to appoint a pair of group members as
-
-scouts.
-
-Don’t act on rumors. It’s common at demonstrations for someone to approach a group of activists
-
-shouting, “The riot cops are coming!” As often as not, of course, there are no police coming at all. These
-
-people may simply be panicking, or they may be agents trying to confuse you. Acting on bad information
-
-is disruptive at best, and often dangerous. All critical information needs to be verified. If the person
-
-conveying info can’t claim to have witnessed something directly, or if he or she is a stranger, then that
-
-information is unreliable.
-
-Assume the riot cops may be coming. While acting on rumors and fear-mongering can be disruptive and
-
-dangerous, it shouldn’t be surprising when the “authorities” do decide to blockade, surround, penetrate or
-
-break up a demonstration. This happens frequently, and the key to not being caught off guard is to stay
-
-prepared.
-
-
-
-Don’t panic; help others stay calm. Sometimes at actions, the situation grows just plain frightening. But
-
-panic reduces critical judgment, adapting and coping abilities, and it can spread rapidly. Our best defense
-
-in a crisis is our collective cool - keeping each other centered & focused. If you can’t stay focused and
-
-centered, then you need to quit the demo to calm down. Similarly, if someone else can’t be calmed down,
-
-they need to leave.
-
-Your best offense and defense is being part of a solid group. Groups combine various skills and powers.
-
-Savvy groups practice often, plan, and develop amazing strategies and tactics that are beyond the abilities
-
-of individuals. They have the numbers to do the various tasks: act, scout, medical, communicate with
-
-others, security, etc, yet they are small enough to act quickly.
-
-Fighting Police Tactics
-
-Often, the police strategy at a protest they want to end is to disperse the participants. They tend to operate
-
-in coordinated units, and use the following tactics
-
-* Show of force to intimidate and scare people away.
-
-* Surprise attacks by troops hidden in reserve.
-
-* Surround and isolate entire crowds – sometimes not allowing people to leave or enter. They may
-
-also try to divide the crowd by moving into it at its weakest point. If you see the police about to
-
-attack your weak spot, try to reinforce it. When dispersing demonstrators, they may try to drive
-
-them like cattle towards certain areas and away from other areas. Your group can avoid the cattle
-
-drive dynamic by splitting off from the crowd. This can be effective if the police are operating as
-
-small units and not splitting up to deal with smaller groups outside the crowd.
-
-
-
-* Police will often use snatch squads to perform surprise arrests of individuals they have chosen at
-
-random from the crowd, or whom they identify as “leaders” or “troublemakers”. Snatch squads often
-
-are made up of, or collaborate with undercover agents, and can strike at any time. The best time to
-
-stop a snatch is as soon as the snatch has happened. You need a group of people to break the police’s
-
-grip and some people to act as blocks. An important and low risk role in the de-arrest involves
-
-simply placing your body between the police and their target. Once you have your person back, all
-
-should link arms and disappear into the crowd. The police may try to snatch back or arrest one of
-
-the de-arresters. Surrounding police vehicles containing arrestees and preventing them from moving
-
-might lead to them being released. Cars don’t move very well when they have flat tires, but keep in
-
-mind that when tires are punctured they can be loud.
-
-Always be on the look-out for where your friends are, and be ready to act clearly and sensibly at a
-
-moment's notice.
-
-Outmaneuvering The Police
-
-Don’t let yourself be intimidated onto the sidewalk. Police will push marches onto sidewalks in order to
-
-thin them out and divide them into smaller groups. Once the police force a march onto the sidewalk they
-
-can much more easily direct its movements and single out troublemakers.
-
-Street crossings can be used to move into the roadway though groups may have to turn. In instances like
-
-this people walking bicycles can help form barriers, which will slow down police trying to push into the
-
-march.
-
-
-
-Police move slow, so move quickly and in a large tight group. Occasionally running in a coordinated
-
-manner will help to keep the police always behind you. Countdowns will not only intimidate the police
-
-but they get you all charged up before running. Moving the wrong way down one-way streets my thin out
-
-the demonstration (as people have to make room for stopped cars) but it makes it very difficult for large
-
-groups of police to follow. Look outwards from the crowd. If someone is being administered first aid, face
-
-away from them.
-
-Form cordons around anything the police want. (buildings, sound equipment, etc.)
-
-Sitting down is good for dissuading police charging but only in large numbers. Sometimes sitting is not
-
-really worth it. Horses and camels are unpredictable. Particularly violent cops, especially those employing
-
-gases or rubber bullets, may be dangerous to sit in front of.
-
-Throwing is a defensive act. It may not be wise to throw stuff at the best of times – that will only provoke
-
-them and make them want to hit you harder. If you want to throw, do it defensively, strategically, and en
-
-masse – a constant hail of debris will create a ‘sterile area’ where the police will not want to go.
-
-Remember: don’t throw to attack or cause injury. Throw from the front and then disappear into the crowd.
-
-Only jerks throw from the back.
-
-Gas canisters can be thrown or kicked away from the crowd before they explode. Be careful! Don’t pick up
-
-with your bare hands, as they can be very hot. They will explode.
-
-Barricades can be more hassle than they are worth. Impassable blockades may be an inconvenience to you
-
-when you need to run. The best barricades are random material like newspaper boxes, dumpsters turned
-
-on the side, and road or construction material, strewn all over. One or two groups can lift small parked cars
-
-
-
-and place them in the street with out damaging them.
-
-The best defense is chaos. If situations change constantly the police cannot keep up. Keep moving. Change
-
-your appearance. Open new directions and possibilities. Be unpredictable.
-
-Watch out for provocateurs including but not limited to “peace police”. These self appointed enforcers of
-
-“peace” infiltrate demonstrations and try to prevent people from walking in the street or engaging in many
-
-forms of protest. They sometimes wear armbands (usually white) and will report people to the police or
-
-attempt to apprehend them personally. Also watch out for individuals trying to instigate violence against
-
-obvious non-targets. These people are often police or employed by them to discredit us.
-
-Countering the Police
-
-With any rowdy crowd, the police will be trying to break it up.They will try to intimidate and disperse
-
-crowds using baton line charges, horse charges, vehicles, gases, rubber/wooden bullets and a few violent
-
-arrests.
-
-The dance steps will include one or more of these:
-
-* Cops in lines will surround you.
-
-* Either from the middle or one side, the cop lines will force everyone onto the sidewalk trying to
-
-create ‘spectators’ & ‘actors’ out of the crowd.
-
-* Baton/horse/gas attack to lower morale.
-
-* Loud speakers, and concussion grenades, to disorient and breakup the crowd.
-
-
-
-* Line charges will slowly push the crowd down the street to where they want you (rush of cops à fall
-
-back à strengthen line à repeat).
-
-* The police cannot arrest large groups of people unless they have lots of little plastic handcuffs.
-
-* The police won’t use tear gas unless they have their own gas masks on.
-
-Stop the lines from forming! Surrounding you, preventing you from going where you want to go, and
-
-pushing you down the street to where they want you to go, all require the police to be in a tight line. It is
-
-important to prevent the first lines from forming. If the crowd seems volatile, they will hold back and form
-
-their lines a distance away. But if the crowd is hanging around looking confused and passive they will
-
-sneak in and form the lines amongst you.
-
-* Don’t stand and watch them. Always stay moving
-
-* Don’t look like you’ll let them anywhere near you.
-
-* Spot gaps in the crowd and fill them. stick together.
-
-* Figure out where they want to go and get there first.
-
-* Protect your escape routes by standing in front of them.
-
-* Get those people who turned into ‘spectators’ back into the crowd and moving around.
-
-Now they may just charge and start arresting. At least you are in a stronger position to deal and your
-
-escape routes are secured. Whatever happens next, don’t stand there waiting for it. Keep moving and
-
-acting defensively.
-
-
-
-If they have blocked your only exit try counter advancing
-
-* this involves moving your lines into theirs thus gaining more space and opening up more exits.
-
-* Use the front line as a solid wall, linking arms and moving slowly forward.
-
-* Try a countdown for a faster advance.
-
-* Use the banner as a plow (this prevents them from breaking your line). Dumpsters on wheels, saw
-
-horses and fencing also work.
-
-If they have blocked your only exit try reforming
-
-always look for ways to increase your number, by joining up with other groups and absorbing
-
-stragglers. Everyone has to get out and you’ll stand a better chance of getting out unharmed, with
-
-all your belongings and equipment if you leave together at the same time.

-Basic Rule: Use as many security layers as possible. The question is not, whether you are paranoid, but whether you are paranoid enough.
-
-A good beginning is to use a VPN and running Anonymous related Software from USB device or a Live CD. A proxy is ok, but is not as secure as a VPN.
-
-Always use as much security layers as possible, but make sure to use them in the right way. If you don't know how to use them, you have to learn it first.
-
-Most anons use VPN to hide their traces, they use SSL encrypted connections and they use #[[vhost]], when they are on IRC servers.
-
-## VPN
-
-When thinking of a VPN service, think first about the legislation of the country. A USA VPN might provide user data upon warrant issue. In other countries, such as Sweden and Iceland, this is unlikely to happen. They have a strong privacy policy, wich makes it harder for law enforcement agencies to get access. In adition, some servers do not keep logs of users. Also try to get VPN services that accept anonymous payments (For those that keep user billing information)
-
-More info: https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Vpn
-
-### Free VPN -- Not recommended. (see explanation)
-
-If they aren't selling you a service. They are selling you. Additionally, many features are capped, and many free VPN providers will hand user data upon warrant. Also, many free VPNs work with ad companies. 
-
-Don't put any sensitive material through it, and you might be fine. Might.

-### VPN Tips
-
-PROTIP: Don't use Commercial pptp on Windows.
-
-It's been said, as telecomix pointed out, that some operating systems (Windows 7, Vista) might be vulnerable to an attack consisting in requesting p2p conns, wich could lead the malicious attacker to get the user real ip.
-
-See https://www.ipredator.se/?lang=en For more information on this matter. Seems flaw has to do with ipv6 conns, so just ensure you use ipv4.
-
-Anything that uses OpenVPN is good. And remember to factor in specific policies on user data storage and policies regarding that data. (Best option, no data loggin + no user billing loggin, + safe payment methods ie: Ukash and similar services).

-## I2P - Anonymizing Network
-
-More info: [[I2P]]
-
-I2P is an anonymizing network, offering a simple layer that identity-sensitive applications can use to securely communicate. All data is wrapped with several layers of encryption, and the network is both distributed and dynamic, with no trusted parties.
-
-Many applications are available that interface with I2P, including mail, p2p, IRC chat, instant messaging and others. All anonymous.
-
-Make sure you start by launching I2P with the I2P Launcher button in the portable apps tray icon.
-
-You can then use the integrated PChat client, it automaticaly connects to the I2P IRC server anonymously.
-
-Join #anonops for to keep track of Anonymous activity. Many Operation channels are relayed between I2P and anonops.ru.
-
-Enjoy your anonymity and privacy!

-### IRC with I2P
-
-* irc://127.0.0.1:6668
-* Channels: #anonops , #opegypt , #opitaly, #opmesh
-* Sites: (currently all down) anonops.i2p qr.i2p
-* Telecomix IRC allows i2p tunnel
-
-For more and active I2P sites visit
-
-* http://inr.i2p
-
-The ports I2P is using
-
-* http://www.i2p2.de/faq#ports
-  * See also your router's configuration.
-
-### I2P installation and running on Linux
-
-* Download and extract the installation files, no need for separate install (such as apt-get install).
-
-* Run the router from /i2p folder with sudo sh i2prouter start. In seconds, I2P should open
-
-a Konqueror-browser page of I2P-main console.
-
-* Configure your bandwith settings. You might also consider opening some ports on your firewall for
-
-optimising the use of your bandwith.
-
-### Portable I2P (windows only)
-
-contains I2P, several plugins (email, torrentclient), preconfigured browser, preconfigured IRC client and messenger.
-
-* http://portable-i2p.blogspot.com
-
-Before you can use anything on I2P, you have to start the I2P router from the portableapps tray icon-menu
-
-with the button I2P Launcher.
-
-### Anonymous surfing with I2P
-
-* Go to your browser options/preferences (depending on your browser) -> network/connection settings
-
-* Select manual proxy configuration
-
-* In http insert 127.0.0.1 , for port insert 4444
-
-* In https insert 127.0.0.1, for port insert 4445
-
-Make sure that you have No proxy for as localhost, 127.0.0.1 so you'll be able to reach your I2P configuration page. To test your anonymity, go eg. to: cmyip.com.
-
-## Tor Onion Router
-
-Basic Rule: Tor does not encrypt the data you send. It just hides your IP by means of cascaded Proxies. Just installing Tor does not mean you're safe. For example, if you use Tor and log in to your real-life-email-account, you're doomed.
-
-### Download Tor
-
-* https://www.torproject.org
-
-Download [Torbutton for Firefox](https://www.torproject.org/torbutton) (enable or disable the browser's use of Tor)
-
-Anonymous provides so called [[Care Packages]]. It contains Tor as well as a bunch of other usefull things. If you cannot access the Torproject website, you may ask in the IRC channels for the Care Package.
-
-## How to IRC
-
-Basic Rule: Use SSL Port (in this case 6697). Always. Use #vhost. Always. IRC is public, if don't want an information to be spread in public, don't give this information in the first place. Ignore trolls. Always.
-
-What is IRC? IRC is a free chat program that people around the world can use to communicate. It features multiple rooms for different chat topics, and private messaging between users.
-
-When you join the Anonymous IRC network, do so only via SSL (point you IRC client to port 6697). Port 6697 is an unusual SSL port, just checking the Always use SSL box will not function. By connecting to SSL-Port 6697 your IRC-Client may give you a warning, because the SSL-Certificate is self-signed. That is OK, it simply means that it hadn't yet been registered to the VeriSign company.
-
-After connection you register you nickname by using a fake email adress, then you /join #vhost and AFTER that procedure you join the channels.
-
-### Basic list of IRC Commands

-
-### Where to find current IRC information incase you can't connect
-
-* http://www.anonnews.org
-* http://www.anonops.ru/?id=servers
-* Facebook (search Anonymous, Operation Tunisia) http://www.anonnews.org/chat (Loads web based IRC client with current server info)
-
-### Security
-
-* Use SSL to connect to the IRC. Server port is 6697.
-* Use VPN software, or accounts to hide your IP. IRC servers are pretty secured, but not invulnerable.
-  * Tor software is NOT an option (It's banned in the network due to malicious abuse).
-
-Extra security consists in getting a vhost (Virtual Host)
-
-* Register your nick:
-
-    /msg nickserv register password fake@email.com
-
-* /join #vhost
-
-* when in #vhost type: !vhost any.fake.host

-
-### How to Vhost
-
-On the anon IRC servers you can ask for a Vhost. This will ensure that you are anonymous on the irc
-
-network. By default you will have a host based from you ISP, something like this:
-
-mynick@theservicefrom.125.comcast.suck.net or a hash if you've logged in by SSL:
-
-mynick@6969E1A1T1COCK152.69.IP.
-
-After setting a desired vhost you could be identified as: mynick@myvhostRocks.org.
-
-1. You must own a registered nick to get a vhost.
-
-    /msg nickserv register password fake@email.com
-
-Explanation: This will tell the register service to reserve your nickname for later use
-
-2. You must identify on that nickname to get it working.
-
-    /msg nickserv identify password.
-
-Explanation: Once you do this step you are ready to set up a vhost.
-
-* Output: services.anonops.net sets mode +r Yournick
-
-Explanation: The +r flag states a given nick is effectively registered and identified.
-
-3. Join the #vhost channel in order to get the vhost working.
-
-    !vhost fake.host.here
-
-Explanation: After you apply for a vhost, the service will ban your nick from that channel for a
-
-given ammount of time. Reasons are many. Lurkers can get real ip's from people. Switching vhosts
-
-each 2 seconds might lag the server, and so on.
-
-3. Eventually you can directly ask for the vhost via command without getting in the specific channel.
-
-   /hs request vhost@hosthere
-
-Explanation: this will avoid getting into the specific channel. But is not enough to get it working.
-
-The vhost@ part is optional, the important part is the hosthere part.
-
-Considering the previous explanation, use the following: /hs request hosthere
-
-    /hs on
-
-Explanation: This will effectively activate the vhost.
-
-### Vhost Trouble Shooting
-
-Q: I have registered my vhost, but once I log in it doesnt activate.
-
-A: Have you identified with your nick? You will only get your regular vhost back once
-
-your nick
-
-is correctly identified, redo step 2.
-
-Q: I just changed my vhost but it wont apply, why?
-
-A: You need to update your status, in order to make it fully working. Use this:
-
-    /msg nickserv update
-
-* Output: HostServ- Your vhost of hosthere is now activated.
-
-* Output: NickServ- Status updated (memos, vhost, chmodes, flags
-
-Once you do that, you normally should have a fully functional vhost.

-General Browsing Safety
-
-Basic Rule: Always browse in "Private Mode" so that fewer traces of your web history remain on your HDD. Opera, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer all include a form of Private Browsing.
-
-Using a free VPN will ensure your privacy in most situations online. If possible, use USB drives. You can nuke them if needed and if leaves no traces on your harddrive.
-
-Use a different VPN for each of your online personas. When checking real email accounts, FaceBook, use a different VPN than from the one you use for Anonymous activities.
-
-Recycle your online accounts as needed. A virtual name is just that, something people use to refer to you in given situations.
-
-When creating accounts, use VPN or TOR bundle, that will give a bogus origin as well and make use of then Throw-away-emails.
-
-### Useful (mandatory) plugins/extensions for Firefox
-
-* BetterPrivacy (Removes persistent cookies from flash stuff >> *.sol)
-* NoScript (blocks Javascript)
-* AdBlock Plus (blocks Ads) (Subscribe to Easylist and Fanboy's List)
-* Element Hider for Adblock Plus
-* Ghostery (tracking pixels)
-* TACO (More adblocking)
-* Redirect Controller
-* Refcontrol
-* WorldIP (know your country, know your rights)
-* Flagfox (tells you the country of the IP, don't use on Tor)
-* GoogleSharing (GoogleProxy, i use it because Google is censored where i live, anonymizes the search) - Scroogle.org is also a very viable (and worthwhile) alternative
-* User Agent Switcher: Sends bogus browser identity to servers.
-* Optimize google: Allows to block loads of scum google uses to track searchs.
-* Outernet explorer (MacOS) : Searches for a whole pile of shit on the net every 10 seconds or so, ensures anyone tapping packets will have a hell of a time.
-* https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere: automatically loads https on a site if avaliable.
-* Scroogle SSL search (Google anonymously): https://ssl.scroogle.org

-==Hal Turner==
-==Subeta==
-Subeta, a kid's game, adds in a meme. Anonymous does not liek. The raid became known as the "Longcat Crusade". At first he was shitstormed with angry Anons telling him to remove it, but he refused. Keith, the owner of Subeta, put up a message that was a giant middle finger to Anonymous. They did not like it. No, not one bit. Then, the shitstorm came. Thousands of Anons, spamming, DDoSing, and many bruteforcing and fucking up Subeta. Keith, despite all this, refused to give up. Anonymous halted for about a few days, as they were planning. Planning something incredible, something epic. The epic plan? Phishing sites. Hundreds of Subetafaggots became victims as they had their accounts on lots of things stolen. Nearly a whole month later the raid was still in full gear. It ended once somebody stole his GoDaddy account and redirected it to a picture of Will Smith.

-==Habbo Hotel==
-Harbl Hotel is a shitty game played by children. Very exploitable. It all began during the summer, when 4channers decided it would be hilarious to form swastikas (SwastiGETS) and block of users. And it was. /b/ called the entire Anonymous to arms. An epic raid. One that would haunt the faggots of Habbo, and send them running out of their rooms. July 12th. Every room was filled with "nigras" spamming, blocking, and forming SwastiGETS. A few less epic raids occurred, like on MLK Day, September 11th, and World AIDS Day. The second major raid also occurred on July 12th the next year. But sadly, this would be the end to the epic Habbo raids. /b/ lost interest, you can no longer block, less people show up, most people are retarded and can't form SwastiGETS, and it's a pile of fail. A plan has been organized for 2010, see [[Habbo Hotel]].

-==Scientology (start)==
-In a nutshell:
-
-*1. Scientology Tom Cruise propaganda video leaks onto internet.
-*2. Scientology decide to censor the video and have it removed from the internet.
-*3. Anonymous dislikes this censorship and takes up arms, launching a crippling online assault against Scientology.
-*4. This raid draws vast media attention.
-*5. Thus raid becomes corrupted by newfags (of the moral kind) and mutates from online battle into a peaceful, worldwide protest.
-*6. Anonymous withdraws, leaving moralfags to carry on the fight alone.
