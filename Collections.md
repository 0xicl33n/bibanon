*These collections hold an assortment of interesting data.*

* [[LP Archive]] - The Let's Play archive. It's a collection of stories about Something Awful users revisiting games from their childhood and posting humorous commentary. The state of the website has not always been stable, so it's saved here just in case.
* [[Information Library]] - InformantB900's highly informative collection of images from 4chan. This collection attempts to turn the textual components into easily editable wiki pages.
* [[Copypasta]] - An archive of text that was so memetic, they were posted to 4chan multiple times. Sometimes it's awesome, other times shocking, but in the end it's something that just has to be saved. This archive was lost and rebuilt multiple times by various wikis, and as such needs a permanent home here.
* [[Baww Threads]] - An archive of text and pictures that are posted in 4chan's /B/aww Threads, where people come together to share the saddest things they know. Unsurprisingly, these stories end up being real tear-jerkers, and understandably, they're not archived very well.
