* [[Sandman]] Package Manager - A plan to implement the best features of Arch Linux's Pacman and AUR in all Linux operating systems, to make it easier to install and manage unpackaged source code.
* [[Gittorrent]] - Put the DVCS of Git and the P2P download system of Bittorrent, and we can make Git repositories truly distributed and independent from central servers. The possibilities of Gittorrent could forever change the way we develop projects and use software. 
* [[bibanon/Fully_Decentralized_Wiki]] -
