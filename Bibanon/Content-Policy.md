This page details the Bibliotheca Anonoma's content policy.

## Files and Wikipages

* All files MUST follow the [[File Format Standards]]. This is to prevent incompatibility. The use of common, open-source, and widespread formats will greatly aid in portability, and prevent format rot.
* All articles MUST use [[Markdown]] or [[Mediawiki]] as their [[Markup Language]]. Markdown is the preferred format.

## Copyright and Proper sourcing

If you ever feel like copying a page from the internet, you'll need to take note of the original author,  the source website, and it's copyright. Place all of these under the "Sources" section in the wikipage.

* Remember to contact the author with [[this message|Notice of Archival]], before posting their article.
	* what do we do if the author refuses?
