## [[Stories]]

_A bunch of stories that were posted to, and sometimes even affected by the actions of internet communities._

### Anonymous Forums

* [[Densha Otoko]] - If you only look at a single piece from this collection, make it this one. It's a sentimental love story of a fashionable businesswoman and an awkward nerd, who posted his story real time to the users of 2channel (a precursor to 4chan). With the steadfast support of these users, he manages to get the courage to break out of his shell and go out with the girl. There's a good reason why it became 2005's most popular book, movie, and TV Drama in Japan.
* [[Damaged Goods]] - What happens when [[Anonymous]] decides to grow a heart and help a (literally) broken girl smile again?
