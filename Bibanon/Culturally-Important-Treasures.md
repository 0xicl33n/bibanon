## Introduction

In 1931, the Empire of Japan launched a full-scale invasion of China in reaction to the Mukden Incident, a train bombing by their own agents in Manchuria. While the action was condemned by the League of Nations, no country was willing to intervene.

Without a single drop of hope, Chiang Kai-Shek and his band of merry Nationalists could only run away as their country slipped right out of their hands. Even worse, Manchuria was the site of the former imperial capital, Beijing. In this city was the Emperor's gigantic treasure trove of items, coming from every single part of Chinese history. The legacies that had been accumlated over millenia by this ancient culture might just join the ranks of the Library of Alexandria.

To prevent disaster, Chiang Kai-Shek ordered the most valuable pieces to be moved out in an impressive feat of human will. More than 13,000 boxes were carted off by train, horse, and foot as the Japanese advanced further inland.

Even as the Japanese were forced to surrender in 1945, the better trained partisans of Mao Zedong rose up with the support of the people, and the Chinese Civil War began. By 1948, when defeat was clear, Chiang Kai-Shek and his forces simply moved to the former Japanese colony of Taiwan. Along with them came the last 3,000 crates that had yet to fall to the ravages of war. At the very least, some of the greatest legacies of human civilization were safe, if only for a little while more.

Why do I tell this story about something seemingly unrelated? Because when it comes to the treasures of the internet, few have bothered to look for the best treasures and archive them. All communities will die someday, and even the most popular webpages will be forgotten. It's too naive to believe that we will always be able to see such data whenever we want.

If that wasn't enough, our Mukden Incident has begun. [[SOPA, PIPA|SOPA]], [[ACTA]], the raid on [[Megaupload]], all of these hint to a future where people are no longer given the freedom to enjoy these treasures. There could be multiple excuses;  supposed copyright infringement, a witch-hunt against child pornography, and ever more stringent restrictions in the interest of "national security".

Each of the stories collected

## The Collection

This is a list of the best of the best in the Bibliotheca Anonoma. Note that it's a very subjective thing, and it does not imply that the rest of the library is useless filler.

## [[Stories]]

_A bunch of stories that were posted to, and sometimes even affected by the actions of internet communities._

### Anonymous Forums

* [[Densha Otoko]] - If you only look at a single piece from this collection, make it this one. It's a sentimental love story of a fashionable businesswoman and an awkward nerd, who posted his story real time to the users of 2channel (a precursor to 4chan). With the steadfast support of these users, he manages to get the courage to break out of his shell and go out with the girl. There's a good reason why it became 2005's most popular book, movie, and TV Drama in Japan.
* [[Damaged Goods]] - What happens when [[Anonymous]] decides to grow a heart and help a (literally) broken girl smile again?

## [[History]]

### Prehistory

_Long before the World Wide Web, BBS systems, IRC channels, and decentralized USENET gave users a new experience of connectivity that few have ever witnessed before._
