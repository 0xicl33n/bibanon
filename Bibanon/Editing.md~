## Wiki markup

When you click "edit" at the top of any wiki page, you'll be sent to a page showing the wiki's source code. Rather than spitting out some html code, it gives you a text format that is easier to read, and one that you may be familiar with, along with some buttons.

On this wiki, we allow only two markup languages: [[Markdown]] and [[Mediawiki]]. Click the links to learn how to read them. Markdown is strongly recommended for new pages, while Mediawiki is only used for compatibility reasons.
