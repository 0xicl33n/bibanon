Here is a list of all the known mirror servers of the Bibliotheca Anonoma.

## Syntax

To hopefully make this list parsable by other programs, use this syntax in all links:

  * Name of mirror - <link to mirror>
    * Short description of your mirror

## Mirrorlist

* Github Project Wiki - <https://github.com/treeofsephiroth/bibanon/wiki>
  * A temporary main mirror, to be phased out when Iruel's OpenShift mirror has an authentication method added. You'll need a github account to edit.
* Iruel's OpenShift Mirror - <http://wiki-bibanon.rhcloud.com/>
  * The Future main mirror, built by the creator of the Bibliotheca Anonoma. It's still under construction for now.
