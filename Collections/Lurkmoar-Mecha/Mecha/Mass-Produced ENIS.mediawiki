A Mass-produced [[ENIS]] variant. Made of less durable materials, but there are many, as they are relatively cheap to produce.

Apparently created by the [[Lion Empire|Lions]] from either stolen ENIS schematics, or from collected battle data. They consider this to be the ultimate Mass-produced unit.

The [[CF-06]] ENIS Variant is the [[Federation of Allied Planets|FAP's]] answer to the Lion's MP-ENIS unit. It seems to he highly inferior.
