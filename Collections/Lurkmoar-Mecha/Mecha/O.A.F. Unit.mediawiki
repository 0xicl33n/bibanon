Full name: War Machine Series 20, Offensive Armada Fighter (O.A.F.)(WM-20 2H788)

Grunt mechs, but decidedly not made of cardboard compared to some other grunt mechs.

O.A.Fs and A.X.Es are Basically the same, except the A.X.E should have the JEK symbol and a deep red color scheme, while the O.A.F. should have the Tyrannis symbol and a Green or blue color scheme. Another thing to look into would be non-lethal weapons, especially in the A.X.E units. Their mission is, after all, to capture the Chimeras, not destroy them.
