'''XAT-001 KERYKEION MARK II'''

Developed by Corusa Industries as a refinement on the original Kerykeion, the Kerykeion Mark II is a mass-production model AT designed as an all-purpose ground trooper.

''General Specifications''

*All-range combat unit, with a specialty in close combat.
*Battery-operated with an operating time of three hours on a single charge with normal combat activity.
*Stands 18 meters at attention.
*Capable of jumping up to 300 meters, but incapable of flight.  Thrust is provided via verniers located in each foot, knee, and on the back.
*One pilot seated in cockpit in upper chest.

''Weapons''

*Four beam submachine guns mounted two on each wrist.  An improvement over the gatling guns of the original Kerykeion, the beam weapons make the frame lighter as a result of not needing to carry ammunition.
*Folding blade mounted along the right forearm, which flips out for close-combat.  The blade is anti-beam coated to penetrate energy field defenses and clash against beam sabers, and is longer than the Kerykeion's twin swords.

''Armor''

*2-inch Titanitefloalloy armor plating, good for protection against all degrees of small-arms fire and most solid-state ammunition.
