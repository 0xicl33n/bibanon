Ancient battleship built by the Second [[Lion Empire]]. A massive vessel that could destroy the fleets of entire star systems on its own, obliterate whole planets, and destabilize stars into a supernova. Also a mobile palace, from which the Lion Emperor was supposed to rule the galaxy. But it was never used. The Anons, using the power of the Gar Crystals, completely destroyed the Second Lion Empire (at the time calling itself the New Lion Empire) in a cataclysmic battle at Proud and forced it back into the Stone Age. Outlying Lion Empire colonies were abandoned or killed off over the centuries, while Calypso was left in the asteroid shipyard in which it was built. Over time, it acquired a shell of rock and became a small planetoid, and was captured by a gas giant's gravity field, becoming a moonlet.
