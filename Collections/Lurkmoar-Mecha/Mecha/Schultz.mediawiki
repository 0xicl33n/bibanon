Full Name: Tyrannis Warship G-43, Schultz

Captain: [[Mina Kusagi]]

A Class 1 Tyrranis Warship under the order of [[Mina Kusagi]]. 

==Weapons and Abilities==

Mounted with a truly epic set of missile bays. At it's fully manned status it can send a continuous missile barrage in every direction for up to 5 minutes straight (Note for SRW usage, think Badass MAP skill). 

Is also secretly mounted with a single secretly constructed nuclear missile as a failsafe measure. If Tyrannis can't have the Chimeras, nobody will have the Chimeras... (Feel free to make this an attack in SRW, though it most likely won't be seen in the series proper)
