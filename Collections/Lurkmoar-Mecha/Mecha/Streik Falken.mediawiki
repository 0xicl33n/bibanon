'''XAT-003 STREIK FALKEN'''

Developed by Corusa Industries to serve as an all-purpose aerial superiority craft, the Streik Falken is an advanced jet fighter built to fulfill a variety of aerial combat roles.

''General Specifications''

*All-range aerial unit, with capability to serve as a bomber with optional equipment.
*Battery-operated with a maximum operational time of five hours, fewer with overuse of weaponry.
*Runs 20 meters from nose to tail.
*Top speed of Mach 5, with thrust provided by boosters in the rear chassis.
*One pilot seated in cockpit just in front of upper wings.

''Weapons''

*Four beam submachine guns mounted two on each side.  As energy is more of a concern for a Falken than for a Kerykeion or Arcenciel, the beams are much less powerful.
*Four plasma cannons mounted one on each wing.  The cannons have great penetrative power, and are useful for attacking larger craft.
**Lower two cannons are actually detachable funnel pods, experimental weapons that can be guided remotely.  Most pilots can only handle two even with computer assistance - rare pilots with the ability to think in three dimensions intuitively can handle twice that or even more.
*Nose doubles as a high-shear impact weapon for cleaving through slow-moving enemy targets.

''Armor''

*1-inch Titanitefloalloy armor plating, good for protection against all degrees of small-arms fire and some solid-state ammunition.
