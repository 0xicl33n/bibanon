Beijing Class: Newest FAP battleship design. A total of 12 ships of the line are commissioned, with 9 completed and 2 under construction when war breaks out between FAP and the Lion Empire; more were commissioned afterwards. Named after Earth cities. Three variants of this class exist: The original Beijing-type, an all-around well-balanced vessel; the Berlin-Type,  mounting a Mega-Beam Cannon in place of the secondary hangar bays and possessing a prototype shield system; and the Frontier-Type, possessing more railguns for combat with other vessels, an enhanced powerplant, and a stabilized shield system built off the Berlin-type shield; it also lacks the torpedo tubes and tactical missiles found in earlier types.

Ships of the Line: Beijing, New York, Honolulu, London, Paris, Moscow, Cairo, Tokyo, Berlin, Nairobi(Under Construction), Sydney (Under Construction), Frontier (Under Construction), Washington (Under Construction), New Delhi (Under Construction)

Kīlauea Class: Newest FAP carrier design, based off an old FAP superweapon that was discarded. Fifty years ago, they wer built as planet-devastating Rail Cannon ships, but were was abandoned as too militaristic and inefficient. The original prototype was left in a Naval Reserve Yard orbiting the planet Terranuevo, and was scheduled to be scrapped. It's two sister ships were left in an incomplete state orbiting the Terranuevo, with plans to repurpose them as colony ships, though funding never arrived in sufficient numbers for that plan. Work was carried out scrapping the weapons systems and electronics first, a process that took ten years. Before they could start on the actual superstructure though, tales and rumors of the Lion Empire's march were received by Naval Intelligence, an astute admiral realized that a practically battle-ready warship, larger than even the new Beijing Class battleships, was sitting in a junkyard. He quickly had the vessel brought to the shipyards of Mars to be rebuilt. Rather than putting back the old, cumbersome, and expensive Rail Cannons it had mounted, the vessel was converted to a supercarrier, saving massive costs and providing FAP with a ship to transport large mobile forces with ease. The superweapon was rechristened "Kīlauea" and thus the class was born. Its two sister ships were also saved from the scrapheap and rebuilt as supercarriers.

The three supercarriers are unique in design from one another, and possess different specializations. Kīlauea has the largest manned fighter and bomber capacity of all three, as well as being the only one to mount a Main Battle Cannon. Olympus possesses the largest drone force in the fleet and the most advanced communication and sensor systems. Everest was designed to carry only mobile suits, and is the only one of the three to carry anti-beam weapon shielding.
