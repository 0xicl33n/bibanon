Story Fluff
----
The Fackel was conceived as a machine that could hold its own against multiple warships. However, it was also found to perform exceedingly well as a heavy assault unit. With its multitude of beam weaponry and missiles, it can soften up enemy warships for weaker units, or using its as of yet unknown weaponry, can take out the entire fleet before it even has chance to fight back.

Also notable are its unwired beam cannons, which can separate from the units 'wings' and act independently, either as point defense or supressing fire. They're shaped like feathers, and mount on the unit's bird-like wings that fold up into its body seamlessly. Due to this unique mechanism, many who have seen this unit in combat have sworn to have seen 'angels' or 'big, black crows'. 

The unit also posesses nanomachine technology, allowing it to repair damage, but, most notably, to produce endless amounts of ammunition.
