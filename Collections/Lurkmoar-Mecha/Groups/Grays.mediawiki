== Description ==
A moderately-advanced alien race that humans know well. For centuries, the Horr have preyed upon humans and other less advanced species as pirates, scientists, and pranksters. They took resources, kidnapped and studied members of lesser species, and sometimes played pranks like giving prey an anal probing or telling them ways to achieve unlimited space travel while patently forgetting one crucial ingredient. Their reasons for doing so are varied and many, but the two most important reasons are that SshaSshuu is a world almost covered by ocean and very poor in resources, and that the Horr are desperate for a solution to their population problem. For more than one hundred years, the species has not been able to grow beyond 800,000 individuals. The Horr had hoped to find a solution to their problem through the study of alien species, but they have not found the answer.
