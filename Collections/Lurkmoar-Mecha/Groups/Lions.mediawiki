== History ==
The main antagonists. Controlling a galaxy-spanning empire with hundreds of client and slave races beneath them, numbering in the trillions, they are the most powerful force in the galaxy. Under their supreme leader, [[Emperor Kijani]], they have grown from a few small star systems near the galactic core to a massive conglomeration of various species extending to the very edge of the void between galaxies in just one century. 

No one in the [[Lion Empire]] knows that this is their second great space empire. More than six millenia ago, the Lion Empire had risen from a vicious civil war to become the New Lion Empire, and expanded from a few star systems to a galaxy-spanning hegemony similar to the Roman Empire. This Pax Leo eventually came into conflict with another galactic power, the Moot Dynasty of the Anon species. Both empires were destroyed through cataclysmic war; the Lions were forced back into the Stone Age while the Anons scattered across the galaxy in giant Dyson Sphere ships and lost contact with one another.
