'''Lion Empire''' is a large, galaxy spanning hegemony that has numerous alien slave races under its command, and the Lions themselves are assumed to be alien-looking humans (i.e. they're people, but they have a third eye or a tail or weird hair or something). '''Much stronger than humans, double heart and lungs, claws on hands, and tails.''' They have ships shaped like sword hilts. They're fighting against humankind *'''in their quest to rule the galaxy'''*, and they initialy control [[Ada Zul/Zuru]], one of their ace pilots who eventually defects to the good side with [[VA-INA]], but not before giving the Lions the plans they need to mass produce the ENIS. Mood-wise they are described as "pretty one-dimentional "Skelator" bad guys".'''Not liking this much.'''

The Lion Empire is a mighty conglomeration of various alien races united under Lord Kijani, Supreme Emperor of the Lions. Defeated in battle or joining willingly, many alien races live alongside the Lions, making the Lions a clear minority in the Empire. But the Lions have proven themselves to be benevolent, if intolerant, rulers. 

Copypasta'd ideas:
1.Lions are a large and hungry race that must constantly expand and devour more and more in order to support their massive civilization.
7.The Anons, way back when, fought and defeated the Lions and then the Lions regressed back to the Stone Age due to the sheer devastation the war caused. The Lions evolved back and started a new war.
* Expanding on the 'Lion Empire consists of many different alien races' idea, the different alien races may each have their own ideas about conducting the war against FAP, ranging from fleets of starships to hordes of power armor to squadrons of real types to a collection of super-types, giving ENIS & company a variety of enemies to defeat.  The Lion Empire can be divided into different racial factions or Houses.  The Lion Emperor encourages this rivalry & competition as he (it?) believes that this would make the Empire stronger.  He draws the line at actual inter-faction combat, though.

== Units ==
=== Reals ===
* [[GR3-Y Fox]]: A mass-produced, stealthy infiltration unit used by elite units for recon, shock attacks, and flanking tactics
* [[BXR-7mk2 'Godhand']]: A melee-oriented unit, with the ability to generate intense amounts of heat around any part of its body.
* [[Mass-Produced ENIS]]: A weaker, less-effective version of the ENIS created by the Lion Empire using a combination of stolen, partially complete schematics and from analyzing ENIS' combat data. The most powerful mass-produced unit ever introduced. 
* [[Anti-Battleship Prototype Fackel]]: A unit suited to taking down enemy warships. Utilizes unwired beam weaponry and rumored to have highly advanced nanotechnology, as well as an experimental AI system. 
* [[TR4N-Vestite]]: Heavy assault unit designed for long-range battlefield support. Also possesses an emergency melee mode.

=== Supers ===
* [[Behemoth]]: A powerful mech focused strongly on beam weapons. Has a unique man-machine operating system which grants the pilot powerful computative and analytical powers at the cost of severe mental stress.  
* Caller: A puppeteer Super capable of controlling even ENIS.
* [[Im.C.M.L]]: Low-end Super built by a Lion Empire race that is at a low technological level, around FAP levels.
* [[Kaminari]]: Second-most powerful mech in the Lion Empire after Crush Engine.
* L*
* [[RAEP]]: A limited production elite covert mech focusing on melee combat, immobilization and scare tactics. Has a fearsome reputation but is surrounded in mystery.
* [[RaePOST]]: Unique unit based on the [[RAEP]] model. Piloted by [[D]].
* [[Predamax]]: Sentai super.
* [[Surion]]: An agile mech focused on melee combat. Equipped with a unique neural control scheme that can only be used by cybernetically enhanced beings or androids that enhances the mech's responsiveness to a pilot's commands, resulting in near-instant response times.
* Stomper: Compliment to Whomper.
* The Big Boss: Massively oversized Super designed for taking on battlefleets.
* [[Torirobiter]]: Massive mech based off a swarm principle. Consumes raw materials to build smaller versions of itself, that act as drones of the main unit. Smaller versions can, with time, grow to be just as large as the original and obtain the original's capabilities.
