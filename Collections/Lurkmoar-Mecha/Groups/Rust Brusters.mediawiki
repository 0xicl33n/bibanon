THE RUST BRUSTERS
* Kick ass
* salavage parts
* ??????
* PROFIT
Desert Junkyard Bandits.

Military geniuses, framed by jealous subordinates and betrayed by society, forced to escape jail and become desert junkyard bandits.
The [[Lion Empire]] shows up, the Rust Brusters kick ass, but eventually fall. Lion Empire is impressed and offers riches if they can retrieve the [[ENIS]] and turn their back on Human society. They agree because they're pissed at earth also.

Insert elite group of 4 that unexpectly shows up at the end of a victory condition just to piss you off and make you wish you didn't use all your SP already.
