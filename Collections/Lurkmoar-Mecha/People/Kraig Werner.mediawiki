The token "Bishi" of the piece. Also, imagine him with whoever is Viral's VA in Gurren Lagann.

History: 

Is said to have been born with the birth of the war. His birthday is, after all, the day of Russia's bombing at the hands of the mysterious faction.

Most of his past is shrouded in mystery. All that is known is that he was brought up an orphan, and joined an experimental "Superman" program to create the perfect soldier. He is the only recorded survivor of this experiment.

He quickly rose in the ranks, and at 20, he is the youngest commanding officer in the JEK military. 

At the present he is involved in a mission to capture the three Chimeras that are on the run, and possibly, capture the Engineer pilot of the "Rerun" alive. The other pilots, as well as his own troops, are expendable.
