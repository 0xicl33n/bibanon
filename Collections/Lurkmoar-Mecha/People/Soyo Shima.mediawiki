*Description: Soyo is a polite, if somewhat blunt, young lady. Her hair comes down to her shoulders and is usually kept in a ponytail. Her cyborg battle mode should have a wind motif.

*Background: Soyo is the middle child of the Shima siblings. She was the inspiration that drove Professor Shima to build the Kazejin. Although she supports her father and mother's work, she is also quick to point out the potential flaws in a project or plan. After Itachi's attack, she along with the others memories were transfered to cyborg bodies. She was the last to regain her memories, after recovering from her injuries she sustained while trying to stop Tetsu and Laika. During the fight against the Yoma, she develops feelings for Yari Kishimoto.
