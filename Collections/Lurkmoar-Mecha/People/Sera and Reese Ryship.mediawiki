Sera and Reese are the twin bridge bunnies serving onboard the ''Arbalest''.

==Appearance==
Both Sera and Reese stand 5’11”, weighing around 130 pounds.  Their eyes are dark brown, while their hair color is the only thing different between them - Sera's is a light brown color, while Reese dyes hers white.  That said, they have been known to trade colors (and identities).  They wear their hair in a style akin to a broken eggshell.  As bridge officers, they wear matching uniforms - light gray vests over white shirts and matching gray shorts, with white stockings.

==Personality==
It almost seems like Sera and Reese are the same person at times - both are wildcats by nature, and nurture has done little to hinder this.  As a result, they have the tendency to serve as comic relief, being both flirtatious and prone to running their mouths.  Their habits of dressing as one another don't help.

==Mechs==
None.
