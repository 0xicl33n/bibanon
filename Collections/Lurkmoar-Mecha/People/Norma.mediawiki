[[Image:AreYouEvenListening.jpg|thumb|right]]
An Artifical Intelligence program that can pilot the [[TUL-BAWCS]] unit, as well as control the weapon-creation/material-processing power inherent in the TB operations. High level intelligence, with a true personality.

Manifests as an adorable little girl in a hard hat, possibly betraying Noland's preferences.
