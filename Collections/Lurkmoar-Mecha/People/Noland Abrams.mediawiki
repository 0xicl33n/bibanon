== The Story So Far ==
A skilled mercenary soldier who is loyal to the Lion Empire in principle, if not always in fact. Noland first fights [[Dr. Nomos]] in his newly constructed [[ENIS]], using a [[GR3-Y Fox]] with the [[TUL-BAWCS]] attached, and wins, but is defeated by Ohta. This awakens in him an inner fire, and a resolve to defeat ENIS at all costs.

When Noland walks into the hangar containing the unfinished A-NL, however, he discovered that the previousely non-functioning OS was awakened by his newly-discovered inner HOTBLOOD. He suddenly got an idea in his head. If he could steal the [[A-NL]] away and use the TUL-BAWCS to finish it, he could use it to defeat the ENIS and prove himself the better warrior. This is exactly what he did. He took [[A-NL]], and [[TUL-BAWCS]], and escaped to plan for his inevitable meeting with the ENIS.

Over the series, the two mechs will Clash. [[Ohta]] and Noland will find that they are really two of a kind. The final battle will come at the end of the series, after the Lion empire is defeated, where [[ENIS]] is the ultimate victor, and Manly [[Gar]] tears are shed as [[A-NL]] is defeated, but is proven worthy.

An appropiate running gag with Noland is that the care and attention he gives to [[Norma]] leads people to think he's some sort of pedo, while he's really just got the 'gushing father' thing with his AI 'daughter'.

== Story behind Honneamise ==
[[Honneamise]] means "Person of Honnea," a reference to their original home planet of Honnea. Driven from the planet by an ecological disaster brought on by the fall of their moon, they roamed the galaxy for decades before the [[Lion Empire]] took them in and gave them a new planet, Lhadatt. They gratefully serve the Lion Empire when they are called upon, and are some of the Empire's best warriors.
