== History ==
Ada begins as an ace pilot within the Lion Empire, piloting [[Surion]]. She suffers her first defeat at the hands of Ohta, but refuses to give up and returns to fight him. After the second, hard-fought defeat, she is sent back to the lab, and there encounters VA-INA. She awakens the mech because she is compatible with VA-INA's Coldblood-run OS.
