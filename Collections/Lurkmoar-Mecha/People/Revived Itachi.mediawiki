*Description: Now a human/yoma hybrid, Itachi is more insect like. His body is covered in natural body armor and his left eye has been replaced with a cybernetic one. 

*Background: After Itachi was killed in battle, the Yoma were revived shortly afterwards. As they combed the battlefield, the Yoma noticed Itachi's mech and inspected it. They found Itachi barely alive, most of his body gone. The Yoma were about to finish him when their leader noticed his hatred and had him spared. They recnostructed his body, and he was reborn as a human/yoma hybrid. Seething with anger, Itachi takes his Supay on the battlefield for revenge.
