The "mother" of all of the Lion Empire's monsters. She was the first to put the concept behind [[TUL-BAWCS]] into actual use, with the [[WANT-LOTS]] system. But she based her designs on biological creatures and features, and lost control of the unit. She became an outcast, and was sent to pursue her research in isolation. She was brought back into the military when the Lion Empire began to run itself too thin with its Supers, to bolster their numbers, and participated in the attack on the Moon-Ship. Developed the concept behind [[Final Sauce]] after capturing [[VA-INA]] test unit. Also developed the concept behind D, and sent Liger to [[Ohta]]'s homeworld as a test unit.
