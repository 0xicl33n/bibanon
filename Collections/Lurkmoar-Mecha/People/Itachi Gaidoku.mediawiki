*Description: Itachi is a well built man with many muscles and scars across his body. His left eye is unusable and has a deep scar that covers the left side of his face. He is a cold, vile man that loves the suffering of others. 

*Background: Itachi first made his prescene felt when he fought on Gyaros's side during the Unification Wars. When Gyaros and it's allies lost the war, Itachi was captured and ready to be executed when the Fire Legion saved him. The Fire Legion saw Professor Shima as a obstacle, so they sent Itachi to attack the ceremony. He caused lots of damage, but failed to kill Kochi Shima and his wife. It was also there he would meet Ken Masurao and develop a rivalry with him. He and his squad would be a constant threat until they were killed in battle, but that wasn't the end for Itachi....
