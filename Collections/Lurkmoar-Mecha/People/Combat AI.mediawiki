*Background: Developed by the Yoma, the first two combat AI, S-01 and M-01, were placed inside Chasa and Chau to survive the cosmic storms and awaken the Yoma after they passed. S-01 has a male personality while M-01 has a female personality. The mass produced versions put inside the Quil units do not have individual personalites.
