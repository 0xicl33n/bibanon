*Story: 65 Million years ago, the Dinosaur Kingdom was at its pinnacle until it entered a conflict with a mysterious Empire that arose from the underground and entered a massive world war that lasted until the empire unleashed a horrifying super weapon that accidentally caused an Asteroid to impact upon Earth, causing the downfall of the Dinosaur Kingdom and forcing the mysterious empire to retreat to the underground to await its time to strike again. The super weapon exploded into several parts and were scattered around Earth, awaiting to be found. The Dinosaur Kingdom knew that this day would come when all of the super weapon parts would  be found again, so as their last legacy, they buried a metallic warrior in the shape of their mightiest warrior, the Tyrannosaur Rex! 

65 Million years later, a group of archaeologists and paleontologists are on an expedition to Canada in search of a rumored fossil that defies logic. One day, the son of the leader of the expedition discovers a Ruby stone engraved with mysterious writing and later that night, he wanders into the forest around the site and drops down a hole and comes to face with a certain Metallic dinosaur...
