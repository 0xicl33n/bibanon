A company called Rocketboom, armed with MILLIONS of dollars per year in Sony Entertainment 
capital has been appropriating our culture by starting a website called [http://knowyourmeme.com/ Knowyourmeme]. 
Rocketboom(more like Cocketboom) literally gets OVER 9000 a week from Sony-- 
totalling [http://brofi.st/u/http://techcrunch.com/2008/08/05/rocketboom-inks-seven-figure-distribution-deal-with-sony/ millions of dollars].<br><br>

[[Chan]]s scrape by completely unprofitable while these goddamned Jew York City kikes get MILLIONS to steal our work and slap some fucking advertisements on it.<br>
Knowyourmeme, backed by fucking JEW money, is making MILLIONS and not giving a goddamned thing back to the sites that generated its content.<br>

Fellow anons, this is the worst thing for our people since Jews flew an airplane<br>
into the world trade center to get us to foot the bill for their<br>
empire-building in the middle east. <br>
This is worse than Ebaumsworld, even. <br>
This is big multinational corporate theft of the products of our culture.<br><br>

Let's show them that we won't stand for it.<br><br><br>

==Offenses==

===Meme Theft=== 
You won't recognize any of the memes on their homepage.

===Jewry=== 
Makes millions of dollars.

=Plan=
==Round One==
The date is May 8th. that's the second Saturday in May. <br>(Who put the 7th? Fucking idiot.)
We need stuff posted around the all of the chans. <br>
Make sure they know that this IS happening and were just looking for more support. <br>
That's really important.<br>
We need some scouting done on KYM.<br>
For the attack itself, a porn raid first. <br>
If anyone can find the site owners than we can get them a pizza dinner 
but i think the best way to shut them down is bandwith raep. <br>
DDOS was decided against unless it could go on for days and not just a few hours.<br>
<br>
We DO NOT need a chanology esque jewtube video.'''
Also, do not start thinking this is serious business or it will all fall down moots ass.<br>
We need to get moving with a May 8th attack date.<br>
<br>
Lets get to work
[Review] So I'm sure we all noticed what fail the 8th was. The site wasn't even slow that day.
There are at least two reasons this could be so: 
1. KYM is smarter than we thought and knows about
this page and was prepared to counter the raep. If this is the case, we need more secrecy about bandwidth raep dates.
2. KYM is not as much of an enemy as we believed. Let's face it: KYM has a better database and
singular purpose than the chaos that is ED, and has drawn many newfags to the cause. Maybe people
like the site and are choosing not to raid it?

==Round Two==
The date is set for Round Two of OPERATION Stoptheirscheme.

On the 4th of December we unite to click as many ads as possible, this will result in getting them disqualified for suspected click-fraud which will mean they lose their source of income.

This will continue for a week until the 12th. On that the we fill the KYM boards with as much gore and porn as possible.

Required prep:
* Make fake accounts on knowyourmeme.com
* Stack up on gore/porn (if you haven't already)

==Scheduled Raid==
===First Round===
May 8th: Porn raid/ruin life tactics, moar dox needed.
===Second Round===

1) Mass flag/report of youtube vids from KYM, so as to cut off their main flow of new users. Date for this is admittedly tentative. Let's keep the date agreed upon this time.

2) Psyops on KYM forums. The mods are banhappy fuckwits, but the users are all more than thrilled to supply us with personal info, histrionic rants, and other potentially useful/lulzy data. They all realize they are stealing chan culture to fuel their discussions, but vehemently deny it.

3) Potential meme tracing and watermarking using 4chanarchive.com and related sites, to prove ownership and force them to take prominent content down.

4) Alert ALL copyright holders to memes that use copyrights (milhouse, etc.) featured on KYM.

5) Spread the anti-KYM sentiments to all sites that they steal from. It's not only Anonymous losing here.

6) Start spamming guro and shock imagery on all chans to clean out the KYMfags. A cursory glance at their forums show that the ones who don't fear the chans outright are at least a little disgusted by them. Since 4chan's /b/ is the most famous, it's a good place to start.

7) DDoS is useless as far as we can tell; you can't really fuck with a Sony-owned server.

8) Don't disclose important plans on 711! [http://knowyourmeme.com/forums/meme-research/topics/5355-tub-girl-is-it-a-meme It's compromised.] Oh, and use Pain Series, guro and shock images to freak out the weak-stomached KYM spies that are still watching. See (6).

9) Copyright fucking everything. If we can add copyright to the memes we create, they can't add them without considerable cost to reputation and pocketbook. I'm developing a program that can do this, but until then, type `echo "This is licensed under the Lesser Online License: Web Uncapitalization Treatise (LOLWUT)." >> notcp.jpg` for every file in your meme folder into a Notepad document, name it lolwut.bat, then run it. For Linuxfags: just go to your meme directory and type `echo "This is licensed under the Lesser Online License: Web Uncapitalization Treatise (LOLWUT)." >> *.*` into Terminal.
But most importantly:

TELL THE *CHANS. Sound the copypasta alarm in every damp, filth-encrusted corner of the internet that has even a trace of Anonymous. Other than KYM of course. Anon only exists there in pictures they stole.

* Go to Omegle or some other pedo-filled chat (freechatnow.com is nice) with a feminine username. Start flirting with a pedo, then give them the above dox, while telling them you want to meet them.

====DDoS====
rocketboom.com, (208.97.158.203)

Because trying to take down a website with a number of hits well above 9000 is a great idea. Especially when the aforementioned company could buy 4chan several times over, and thinks they're relevant in internet society.

Want to really fuck with them? Petition your local *chan owner to invoke ownership and cease-and-desist Rocketboom. Losing content for them will start an internal shitstorm.

==Copypasta==

===4chan /b/===
Fellow anon, 

A challenger approaches. You may be familiar with rocketboom.com, with its novel take on online tv. The man who brought you that website has teamed up with Sony to create KnowYourMeme.com. 

Go and visit it, right now. I'll wait here.

Yes, Andrew Baron has taken our beloved memes and whored them out for profit. Andrew and Sony have stolen what should belong to nobody - lulz. We cannot let them and their billions of jew dollars destroy what we have worked so hard to create. By making this site, Andjew has woken the beast that is anon.

Remember when Faux news did a report on us? And we were featured on Jeopardy? And the Facebook faggotry? 

All of this is threatening to destroy what we stand for - anonymity, lulz and everything that society despises. If we allow KnowYourMeme to escape our wrath, we are signalling to the interwebs that we have become weak.

Lets show those fuckers that we're still the final boss of the internet.

We are Anonymous
We are Legion
We do not Forgive
We do not Forget
