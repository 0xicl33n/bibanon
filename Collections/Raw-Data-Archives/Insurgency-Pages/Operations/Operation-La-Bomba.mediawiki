== Intro ==
The Islamic Holy month of Ramadan begins on August 22, 2009. It is on this day, my fellow Anons, that we shall finally lash out in the name of our beloved freedom of speech and network neutrality which Google seems so eager to bereave us of. Starting on ''August 22, 2009 at 5:00PM EST'', we will upload videos to YouTube that depict Muhammad, Allah, and other prominent Islamic figures demonstrating their affection for pigs or engaging in homosexual acts. Verbal criticisms of Islam would also be effective, especially if prominent YouTube accounts were to be compromised and employed in this raid.

'''You must under no circumstances begin your attacks any earlier than August 22, 2009 at 5:00PM EST, and absolutely no pornographic content is acceptable (''We do not want a repeat of "Porn Day"''). The violation of either of these rules will greatly detract from or even destroy the message of the entire raid. Try to remember that on of the major points of this raid is to cause Google to censor our videos without a legitimate reason, as this will illustrate their true feelings about free speech.'''

=== TL;DR ===
Anons to PA for christfags, in an effort to make youtube look like they censor videos.<br>

== Rules ==
#'''This raid begins August 22, 2009 at 5:00PM EST. Do NOT begin early or post anything about it on /b/ more than a few hours in advance!'''
#'''No pornographic content is acceptable for use in this raid. Violation of this rule will defeat the entire purpose of this raid, and result in catastrophic failure.'''
#'''DO NOT MENTION ANONYMOUS OR ANY *CHANS IN YOUR VIDEO DESCRIPTION OR ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE VIDEO. Just tag Allah, Muhammad, or whoever the fuck they worship. For example: "May Allah be praised in this holy Month of Ramadan", "Praise Allah", "Allah loves his people", etc.'''

== How to make a video for this raid ==
#Open MS paint, Paint Shop Pro, Gimp, etc. W/e you prefer.
#Google pics of Muhammad, Allah, Koranic verse, etc.
#Edit the pictures so that they will cause an enraged reaction. If you can't figure out how to do this, you should consider becoming an hero. '''Warning: Epic lulz may ensue. Those who suffer from lulzsensitive seizures should an hero.'''
#Throw them into Windows Movie Maker, iMovie, Final Cut, or w/e Linuxfags use and publish the result on YouTube. Add some Arabic music for extra credit!
#???
#PROFIT!

''(PROTIP: Prepare a large numbers of videos and pictures prior to the raid. Upload them on August 22, 2009 at 5:00PM EST)''

== How to promote your videos in this raid ==
'''If we don't execute this raid well; no Muslims will rage and YouTube will brush off our videos as nothing.'''<br>

To help promote the success of this operation, we should prepare to do two things.

#Set up a series of bots that will rapidly increase the view counts of our best videos. [http://3magin8.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=58753 Link]
#Pretend to be an average Muslim and go to popular Muslim forums. Post the videos and call them an outrage. Whine and tell the Muslims that action must be taken and that YouTube should be askked to remove the videos. (DO NOT MENTION ANONYMOUS OR ANY *CHANS ON THEIR FORUMS!!!) [http://www.islamicboard.com/ Link 1] [http://muxlim.com/ Link 2]

These two actions will greatly increase the amount of attention given to our videos, and consequently more lulz will be had.

== Message to Muslims from Anonymous ==

#Download the video: http://www.megaupload.com/?d=HYNE2DZ1 (If you want to make translations, use this one: http://www.megaupload.com/?d=93F28GN4)
#Upload it to YouTube on August 22 5 pm EST
#Make the title: Message to Muslims from Anonymous 
#Place the following in the description, even the Arabic translation:

Hello leaders of Islam and all those regarding to Islam. We are Anonymous.

Over the years, we have been watching you. Your destructive behavior towards others are noticed by many of us. Your people continue to plunder the lives of many in the name of your prophet and god. We do not approve of this campaign you run.

Anonymous will continue to fight back and destroy your religion piece by piece. Your religion is a disguise for terrorists, rapists, murderers, and many negative ideals.

Your people and rulers have ridded and censored each person who speaks out against you. You are the true deniers of freedom of speech and are a terrorist cult which we shall disband. We, anonymous, shall bring light and all good back to the people you tricked into believing in your cult ideas.

For every time you have plundered others in the past and destroyed civilizations, we shall dismantle each document of your cult one by one and you shall finally face defeat. For every man that was not given freedom by your leaders, we shall do so as well.

Knowledge is free.

We are Anonymous.

We are Legion.

We do not forgive.

We do not forget.

Expect us.

Arabic translation:

مرحبا قادة الإسلام ، وجميع تلك التي تتعلق بالإسلام. نحن لم يذكر اسمه.

على مر السنين ، وكنا نراقب لك. الخاص بك السلوك الهدام تجاه البعض الآخر لاحظ الكثيرون منا. شعبك مواصلة نهب حياة الكثيرين في اسم النبي محمد واله. نحن لا نوافق من تشغيل هذه الحملة.

غفل ستواصل محاربتها والقضاء على دينك قطعة قطعة. دينك هو تمويه للارهابيين ، والمغتصبين والقتلة ، والعديد من الآثار السلبية المثل.

شعبك وحكام للرقابة والتخلص من كل شخص يتحدث ضد لكم. انك الحقيقية الحرمان من حرية التعبير ، وتمثل الطائفة الإرهابية التي يقوم بحل. ونحن ، لم يذكر اسمه ، وعلى ضوء تحقيق جيدة الى كل الناس هل يتوهم في عبادة الأفكار الخاصة بك.

لكنت قد نهبت كل مرة أخرى في الماضي ، ودمرت الحضارات ، وعلينا ازالة كل وثيقة من وثائق الخاصة بك عبادة واحدا تلو الآخر ، وأنك في النهاية تواجه الهزيمة. أن لكل رجل لم يمنح قادة الحرية في بلدكم ، فإننا نفعل ذلك أيضا.

المعرفة الحرة.

نحن لم يذكر اسمه.

نحن الفيلق.

نحن لا يغفر.

لا ننسى.

'''Anti-lulz removed.'''

== The Master Plan ==
# Upload and spam videos that would offend Muslims to YouTube
# Promote the videos views and proceed to alert Muslim forums. (Act as if you were an average Muslim, and ask for blackup to get them removed.)
# YouTube removes the videos because of pressure.
# The Internet rages as a result their unfair censorship.
# YouTube looks like shit and Muslims are angry. Epic lulz ensue.

==Misc. ways to Troll a Muslim==
# Ask them why Muhammed married a 2 year old. (srsly it's in the Haddith)
# Inform them they that secretly revere Jews and Islam is a Jewish conspiracy.
# Ask them to explain why they worship several gods instead of one like the Mormons.
# Ask if the first day of Ramadan is "Take your dog to the Mosque" day.
# Ask them why all Muslim women dress like sluts, and repetitively show pictures of Haifa Wehbe. 
# Put Halal Stickers on pork rinds, and anything that most certainly wouldn't have a Orthodox union or Halal sticker. Muslims love pork, they just don't know it.
# Show pictures of Admiral Ackbar with "Laliah alahaaah!!" Written below.
# Inform them that '''Baha'ullah''' is your prophet. This will piss them off so bad. Look it up.
# Ask them if the Day of Ashura is about celebrating women's periods.

== Arabic Government Interaction? ==
As we've learned from the video "Internet Censorship: How Cute Cats Can Help" in some cases Islamic centered governments will block websites with anti-Islamic material. If we can get an easily offended Arabic government aware of the situation, a temporary block of YouTube could result. This would be a huge loss in revenue for YouTube and would cause a great deal of butthurt.

== Why not post porn? ==
This section serves the purpose of understanding why no porn should be used in this operation. This raid isn't just about pissing off Muslims. If you fucking read anything in the original 888 post and everything that followed, you'd understand that this is about pissing off Muslims '''AND GETTING YOUTUBE INTO A SHIT TON OF BUTTHURT.
'''
The reason we will NOT use porn in our videos is because we want YouTube to remove the <s>anti-Muslim content</s> protected free speech as a sole result of community pressure from the Muslims. They WILL do this because they are huge pussies that remove everything when pressured. Once the videos are censored then we will trick the <s>activists</s> faggots into bashing YouTube for their unjust censorship. Once <s>this hits the media and becomes controversial</s> the shit hits the fan, they will look like <s>hell</s> your mother's vagina.

So why not post porn? If we post porn, we are giving YouTube an excuse to brand our entire operation as just another porn day. All of our videos, including the ones that don't show porn, will be promptly deleted. This is because they want to delete all of our videos to please the Muslims while appearing to have a valid excuse for shutting the whole operation down without taking heat from anti-censorship groups.

'''ESEENTIALLY IF WE DON'T POST PORN, THEY WILL HAVE HAD NO EXCUSE AND WILL LOOK LIKE FREEDOM HATING FAGGOTS, SO THE INTERNET WILL GIVE THEM A TON OF GRIEF.'''

Stop fucking changing the wiki because you think it's too moral. This started on 888 and we are sticking to the original ideas posted in the original thread. If you don't like it, <s>too fucking bad</s> an hero.
