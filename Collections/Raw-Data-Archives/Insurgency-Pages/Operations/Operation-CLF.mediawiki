=Information=
Cybernations is an online browser game like [[Ikariam]] (really more like Ogame, in that it is mostly numbers becoming bigger) except with much more [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Serious_business serious business] involved. Wars between alliances have been known to break down into DDoS wars and hacking in the past, and treaties are made in only the most serious of manners.

==Alliances==
Alliances are always formed with a legalistic sounding constitution/charter [http://cybernations.wikia.com/wiki/Democratic_Alliance_of_Wise_Nations], and all treaties between alliances are written by Jews.  Power is largely [http://cybernations.wikia.com/wiki/Alliance_stats (51%)] held by the singular alliance, [http://cybernations.wikia.com/wiki/New_Pacific_Order NPO].  [http://cybernations.wikia.com/wiki/Albino_Blacksheep AlbinoBlackSheep] follows in second, and [http://cybernations.wikia.com/wiki/Goon_Order_Of_Neutral_Shoving GOONS] in 13th.

==Gameplay==

=Strategy=
Because of the nature of CyberNations, some planning is involved in properly planning a troll.  Below is a theoretical outline of how this will work:

==Step 1==
Get a base (25-50) of semi-trust-able members through IRC.  Add them to the '''CBWarriors''' usergroup, so that they can view this page on the w/i/ki.  Advertise through word-of-mouth, and by getting ahold of UNCLE_JIM_BOB.

==Step 2==
Have those members join the various alliances, and use [[PsyOps]] to become trusted.

==Step 3==
Start openly recruiting members from [http://boards.4chan.org/b/ 4chan's /b/], among others, as well as /i/.  Have them join a single alliance (name not yet chosen).  Get as many hundreds as possible, and distribute easy to follow instructions (or macros) so that the strength builds up quickly

==Step 4==
The infiltrated members (see: Step 2) declare war on, and attack, each other.  We should have at least two in every alliance, so that there can be an initial two rounds of retaliation

==Step 5==
The infiltrated members then start attacking other alliance members, to drag them into it.  It is hoped that this will bring about a full-on war between the two alliances.

==Step 6==
Next, through [[DDoS|various means]] we take the alliance forums offline, and the skilled members withdraw from their alliance, and join the single alliance with all the /b/tards and such.

==Step 7==
In the confusion of lacking means of communication, and of having wars started (or else diplomatic emergencies), we use the combined strength of everyone in our alliance to rape the shit out of the alliances that we have just fucked with.

==Step 8==
Using a zerg rush combined with oversight from some more experienced members (who probably have bonus resources from their previous alliance), we ramp up our efforts to recruit more people (including sock puppet accounts through proxies), and use them to rape small-medium alliances, issuing '''JOIN US OR DIE''' proclamations.  Basically, a snow-ball effect.

==Step 9==
When we have reached sufficient size, start implanting more operatives into the larger alliances.  Repeat steps 1-8 as needed.
