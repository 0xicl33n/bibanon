==The Underage B&==

[[Image:CussPropaganda2.jpg|500px|right]]

So this butthurt little abortion survivor starts the 'no cussing club' after being bothered by all the swearing at his school. Soon, this shit went bananas as his club attracted an army of <s>moralfags</s> retards getting him the title 'The most cyberbullied kid in the world'. Well I say: YOU HAVEN'T SEEN NOTHING YET.

He ovbiously is desperate for some much needed attention, so we shall give it to him an overdose, for on Jan the 15th, DESTROY, DIE, ATTACK! 

DDOS website/BWraep website, life ruination via box/pizza floods, phone him and tell him how you feel about him! Everything.

{{Quote|Hi, my name is McKay Hatch. 
I am 14 years old.  I'm just a regular kid.  I like to play soccer, play video games, hang out with my friends, etc.  I started the No Cussing Club at my junior high school in South Pasadena, California in 2007.  A lot of kids at my school, and some of my friends, would cuss and use dirty language all the time.  They did it so much, they didn't even realize they were doing it.  It bothered me so much that one day I challenged them to stop!  They were shocked.  They didn't know that it was bothering me.  They didn't even realize how much they were doing it until I said something.  I was actually surprised at how they reacted; they accepted my No Cussing Challenge.  But some of the kids said they didn't know how to stop.  That's when I started the No Cussing Club.|THE FAGGOT}}



== The Raid ==

About a week after the raid started several Anons from the IRC found the password to mcfags dads email address and proceded to get passwords to the host account for the no cussing club website, changing the homepage to the one shown in the encyclodedia dramatica page linked below, and deleting all other pages, LULZ were had for about 30 mins, untill somehow the page was restored. the Anons planned to discredit the book being written by taking screenshots of emails regarding the book, atempting to make people beleive that the book is a hoax to make money.

==CopyPasta==

NOW THIS IS A STORY ALL ABOUT HOW
I PISSED OFF MORE PEOPLE THAN THE LAW SHOULD ALLOW.
AND EVEN THOUGH OUR WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE'S A STUB,
I THINK I'LL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT THE NO CUSSING CLUB.

IN LOUSY CUNTIFORNIA, BORN AN' RAISED,
ON THE PLAYGROUND IS WHERE I SPENT MOST O' MY DAYS.
CHILLIN' OUT, MAXIN', RELAXIN' ALL COOL,
AND ALL SHOOTIN' SOME B-BALL OUTSIDE O' THE SCHOOL,
WHEN A COUPLE O' BULLIES WHO WERE UP TO NO GOOD,
STARTED FUCKING CUSSING UP IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD.
I GOT REALLY PISSED OFF, SO I SAID TO MY PEERS,
"YOU BETTER SHUT THE FUCK UP AND RESPECT MY EARS!"
WELL, NEEDLESS TO SAY, THEY BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF ME,
AND NOW I NEVER GONNA LOSE MY VIRGINITY.
I'M SAD THAT I'LL NEVER KNOW THE PLEASURE OF SNATCH,
BUT AFTER ALL THIS, WHO WOULD FUCK MCKAY HATCH?
I WHISTLED FOR AN AMBULANCE AND WHEN IT CAME NEAR 
THE PARAMEDIC SHOUTED "FUCK THIS SHIT, THIS KID IS A QUEER"
I PULLED UP TO A HOSPITAL, SEVEN OR EIGHT,
AND I YELLED TO THE BULLIES "FUCK YOU, SEE YA LATE!"
AS ONE RAN UP TO ME WITH A .38 SNUB,
I THOUGHT IN MY LAST MOMENTS OF THE NO CUSSING CLUB.
