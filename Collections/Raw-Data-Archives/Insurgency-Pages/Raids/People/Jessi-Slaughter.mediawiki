{{Quote|There have been no death threats or threats of harm in any way [towards Jessi or her family]|Florida's Sheriff's department on how we do not condone illegal activity and are merely good citizens working to expose Jessi's irresponsible parents}}

=Introduction=
Jessica's parents facilitated the production of CP. Jessica's parents endangered their child. Jessica made death threats via the Internet, an act of terrorism as defined by USA PATRIOT. (some people don't appreciate our sense of humor or irony when it comes to evenly applying PATRIOT to Jessica.  It's not so much that we support it, it's that we should use any existing legislation available to us.  And if people think that's going too far, then perhaps it can also be a means to getting the act repealed.  So stop freaking out.)  Jessica has since violated a court order. Make no mistake - we will bring them to justice. (Once again, it's a Bush quote, we hope you can appreciate the humor without accusing us of supporting him.)

==Irresponsible Parenting==
The real problem here is the incompetence of the parents.  Jessi's parents let their daughter not only own a webcam, but turned a blind eye to their daughter making videos consisting of death threats--which are a crime--lewd sexual innuendo, etc.  The parents weren't even aware that her daughter published provocative pictures of herself, which in itself can constitute child pornography (also a crime).

{{Quote|While I am definitely NOT condoning the trolls' behavior, I feel that no 11-year-old (or any tween or teen) should be going online and making videos full of profanity and death wishes. (At one point, Jessica says she hopes that all haters will get AIDS and die.) When are we going to start talking about the real problem here? Why in the world does Jessi Slaughter (the online celebrity) even exist? She may be a very nice girl in the real world, but online she is a horrid young person who is full of herself (not an image I would want my own daughter to portray for the masses).|Momlogic.com on how to get trolled}}

* [http://www.momlogic.com/2010/07/dont_let_your_child_follow_in_jessi_slaughters_footsteps.php Momlogic.com agrees with us]
==Bad Behavior (In School)==
Jessica has a long history of acting up in school. In one incident (date unknown), Jess was suspended from Dunnellon Middle School for 10 days after being accused of slapping a boy in the face and bruising him.  Jessica's mother claimed that Jessica could not have caused the bruise, and that it must have been caused by a softball.  Aside from the fact that young boys don't traditionally play softball, the incident was the earliest known example of her mother's attitude that Jessica can "do no wrong".  Much of Jessica's bad behavior stems from both her parents' head-in-the-sand mentality when it comes to getting involved with Jessica's life.

==Hicks Plus Technology Equals Jessi Slaughter ==
It was July 2010 when the incredible power of technology sent one Florida girl on a collision course with fame (She'll take any she can get), a perfect storm condition developed, a combination of means, motive, and opportunity. Yes, these were present.  But it was what WASN'T present which made this clusterfuck possible.  There was A TOTAL LACK OF BOUNDARIES, PROPRIETY, OR DECENCY on the part of Jessica Leonhardt.  No child schooled in proper etiquette and instilled with any level of pride would have behaved in the way Jessica did.

=== Root Causes ===
Jessica does not outwardly exhibit any signs of mental illness such as autism, bipolar disorder, or psychosis.  She does not fit under the category of adroit liar because well, she sucks at it.  She is clearly a very insecure girl.  This insecurity is most commonly rooted with inattentive parents.  Jessica's parents were obviously never significant role models (or they would have taught her better); they served only as minimal caregivers.  This caused Jessica to strive to prove her superiority in every possible social situation throughout life.  She had one female friend of note and a boyfriend.  Her relationship with him was very likely non-sexual.  The insecurity shows up again when she claims to have 3 boyfriends while on camera.  She feels comfortable on the webcam, but wasn't so comfortable when interviewed by ABC's GMA.  She is a self-proclaimed bisexual despite being a likely virgin.  This is an observed phenomenon in tween girls.  They hear of the unusual sexual habits of famous people, and then they emulate it so they have something to identify with.  This can lead to social problems later on, as she is heterosexual but has only homosexual friends.  

=== Manifestation of Neuroses ===
Another more critical instance of this behavior was in her dealings with Dahvie Vanity.  She was friends with Dahvie until apparently, she told her friends in school that the two of them had sex.  Like any tweens, they badgered her for more information, excited to hear about such a thing, but also skeptical and perhaps a bit jealous (so Jessica's mom said).  When her classmates found out that Dahvie was in his 20s, it was an instant scandal.  Word got around.  One girl's fantasy embroiled the object of her affection in controversy.  Jessica's classmates went home and told their parents, who then called Jessica's mom.  Jessica's mom explained that Jessica was only a songwriter for Dahvie, and that it was an exaggeration.  And it would have blown over if not for...

=== Conflict ===
Unwarranted Self-Importance.  Jessica successfully made up a scandalous rumor, made girls believe she was Dahvie's personal tramp, and all without getting Dahvie into real trouble.  Ego boosted over 9000 points.  Then, she begins making videos, calling out her haters on Youtube.  Which brings us to the cataclysm that rocked her world.  One thing leads to another, you get your dad to whiteknight for you on cam, and before you know it you're on GMA.  There were over 9000 points at which Jessica could have de-escalated the situation before it reached critical mass,  but a lack of rational thought in her household made sound judgment impossible, destining the extreme outcome we have all come to be familiar with.  Not to mention, Dahvie Vanity might now be facing charges because of all the extra attention Jessica brought on herself and by extension, him as well.  Jessica will continue to deflect responsibility, as will her parents.  Dahvie Vanity is the perfect whipping boy for all their problems.

==Jessi Slaughter Gets The Help She Needs (for a day)==
On or around July 17th, Jessica's parents committed her to a mental health facility for adolescents (name of facility needed).  This was done after police were sent to the home at 12:01am on July 17th to investigate Anonymous reports that Jessica might be a threat to herself or others.  Upon further investigation, the police determined that this was not the case.  While at the residence, Dianne requested police protection against those who might bring harm to their [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/White_trash humble]home. The police, short on resources and wanting to go back to eating doughnuts, advised Dianne that they could not offer protection unless there was evidence a threat existed, and that they should commit her to a local mental facility.  Later that day they followed that advice.  After a 1 1/2 day stint at the facility where, "They had to get up at 7am, eat breakfast, do schoolwork, and could not watch TV," Jessi wanted to go home and was signed out of the facility [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Against_medical_advice AMA].  NOTE: In the 7-29-2010 CNN interview, Dianne claims Jessica was kept in the facility for 3 days, against her will.  This conflicts directly with other reports that Jessica begged to be released early and this was permitted because she signed herself in.  Partyvan.info broke the mental hospital story first and it would seem that Dianne is trying to deny her own role in coaxing Jessica into signing herself in.  Moar investigation is needed.

In the ABC interview, Jessica is far from her peppy self and appears drugged.  This is typical of recent [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoners guests]at American mental facilities.  (list of drugs she is taking needed)
===Speculative List of Medications===
*Wellbutrin - 100 mg twice daily
*Zoloft - dose unknown(the only possible doses in zoloft is 75 150 and 225   i am 14 and take 225 zoloft is not something you can overdose on. It is a depression, and ptsd pill. It helps control mood swings. (-xlilbiotchxx)
*Vodka - fifth when needed
*Xanax - with Vodka
*Coricidin HBP Cough & Cold - (for prolonged sexual experiences)

===Actual List of Medications===
(None until Jessi's parents learn about SCHIP, which might take years at this rate.)
===Jessica Begins Out-Patient Therapy===
In the ABC interview, it is revealed Jessica will be seeing a [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Shrink shrink]on a weekly basis.  NOTE: In the CNN interview, Dianne claims they don't have health insurance and therefore, Jessica is not seeing a shrink or a pill-pusher.  Apparently they're too dumb to know about SCHIP. (Name of shrink and appointment schedule needed when applicable.)



=Strategy=
# General
## Prank phone calls for the lulz
## Report her activities, censored screencaps, quotes, etc, to the police, her school, parents, and relatives
###one of her teacher's email address: jane.ashmon@marion.k12.fl.us extracted from the pictures below (internet superheroes)
###J. Black of Dunnellon Police Department - email address: jblack@dunnellonpd.org extracted from the pictures below (internet superheroes)
## Continue to monitor all accounts for new activity, especially any illegal material.  Direct anything damning you find to [http://www.floridadec.org/FLDEC.nsf/pages/47B68524B02E4F3B852570CF005EC873 Florida Child Protective Services]There is an open investigation, this will get the fastest results.
##If you find a new source of pictures or videos we are not aware of, carefully document it.  If a few new photos are getting posted each day there, this is most likely where Jessi has chosen to continue camwhoring.  As not to tip her off, do not tell anyone about it until you think you've milked it for all it's worth.  Then, contact social services with the images as proof that her parents have not taken steps to control her activity.  Give the investigators time to confirm the source of the photos before they are RAGE DELETED by Jessi.  The pictures are damning, but screencaps which include the full url are better, especially when the URL still works when they follow up.  Only when the investigators get a chance to see the account in question should you release the photos to anon.  Releasing them early WILL tip her off.  The enemies of lulz lurk. Loose lips sink ships; Jessica is a perfect example of what happens when you run your mouth.

# Specific
## Find out how to contact other students at Dunnellon Middle School and link them to relevant Jessi Slaughter material in case they're not already aware.
## Sign up for commenter accounts on web 2.0 news aggregation sites, and make legitimate sounding posts exposing her parent's actions, the legality of their daughter's death threads (i.e, "brain slushie", "[all haters should]get AIDS and die", etc).
## Make new Jewtube accounts and upload the full collection of videos with tags.  If enough people upload them, Jewtube may get bored of banning people.  It's pointless, but appeal the bans.  Get the right mod and they may whitelist the vid, as it does not violate TOS.  This will go a long way toward making the general public aware of the extent of this child's shenanigans.  (PROTIP: Set videos to private until indexed, then switch to public.  Flaggers look for new videos by date and keyword.)
## Since she is younger than 13, she violated essentially every Terms of Service by being on any given social networking site.  Report the channels listed below to the company, and get them taken down.

Notice the feedback at the bottom of the screen.  While most stories draw mixed reaction from internet users, 100% of the aired feedback was negative, which means that the producers couldn't find a single sympathetic comment in their mailbox to balance out their coverage (unless you count "Great Parenting -Cathy" as anything other than sarcasm).  Despite over a week of news/media whiteknighting, America is steadfastly immune to the Leonhardt's deceit.

Jessi's new XAT chat: http://xat.com/alone_place Was Closed due to Sum [[ed:goatse|Goatse]]
==Aug 1, 2010==
Lube and condoms were sent to Jessi's house

==Aug 2, 2010==
*Jessi's latest Twitter account is suspended for reported rules violation
*Jessi reveals her newest Xat, REDACTED
*Jessi migrates from her Xat in the afternoon to a Tinychat hosted at REDACTED
*While chatting on microphone about her rape experience, musical aspirations, and razorblade flavored candy, Jessi's mom and dad burst in and begin to threaten Tinychatters who seem overly trolly
*A trollercaust breaks out, resulting in Dianne Leonhardt freaking out when her first name is spammed akin to "DESU" over and over
*Hivemind causes the Tinychat population to break into Destiny's Child's "Say My Name" simultaneously
*Dianne storms out of the room leaving Gene to whiteknight for his daughter and defend his dental situation
*Dianne Leonhardt returns some 30 minutes later hardly able to speak from intoxication, after Jessi claims to have received a Kool-Aid mixed "with something"
*Jessi's mom informs her that she's done the research and Jessi's approximate worth online is 11 billion dollars
*This figure decreases to 11 million after a robust flaming; her slurring increases
*At one point Jessi exclaims "You're going to slap me???"  She sounds like she's going to orgasm.  Her mother replies that she's going to slap "THEM"
*Her mother informs the Tinychat population that she has more education and more wealth than them.  She informs the population that they do not know what drunk is, and that she has more money than they can even ever think about
*Jessi's mother reveals that her non-Rhodic accent originates from the family's roots in Boston, specifically Sterling, MA
*Jessi says the family moved last November
*A powerful moron goes on cam in Tinychat and begins to play Battletoads.  The blaring volume drowns out a fight that's begun between Jessi and her mom.  Eventually Jessi ditches and shows back up on Xat later
*Talk turns to her rape by Dahvie Vanity.  Jessi claims to have lost her virginity at age 10 to Dahvie Vanity despite being 11 when she moved to FL.  She goes on to claim that a headline in Sterling, MA once read DAHVIE VANITY RAPES LOCAL GIRLS
*Jessi claims to be in possession of a semen-stained t-shirt in her garage fouled by Dahvie Vanity from an encounter she enjoyed on May 2.  The original StickyDrama post of her touching Vanity's hand was taken at the May 2 BotDF concert in Orlando.  The shirt is red.

*EDiots attempt to fool the world into thinking Jessi has made a series of new YouTubes, Twitters, Tumblr, and personal clothing site.  Jessi LOLs at them.  http://i36.tinypic.com/10s90k1.png
*She discovers encyclopedia dramatica and futher proves that she won't go silently into that sweet night by posting "fuck you encyclopedia dramatica!!! IM STILL HERE" which can be found here http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Jessi_Slaughter#August_6th

=Ebaums threads=
In a two-week smear-campaign to take down a rival site, Ebaumsworld.com bullishly hounded Jessica.  Family-Oriented site 4chan, despite its best efforts, could not ascertain the exact source of the raid against Jessica because of Ebaums' deployment of a unique combination of SHTTP, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truecrypt TRUECRYPT], AND BITTORRENT.  Ebaums' stealthy secret sub-site is believed to be hidden in the buffers of fiber-optic repeater boxes on top of telephone poles across America.  

As a show of support to Jessica's [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Meth#Methamphetamine meth]-ravaged parents, Family-Oriented 4chan has offered to adopt Jessica despite being "too old".  Gene Leonhardt seems to have refused any offer of assistance, but it can't hurt to be persistent.  Regardless, Jessica seems to be on the fast-track to being put into state custody and being re-located to one of Florida's many fine [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Jewnited_States government]-sponsored tart mills.  For a nominal fee you, too, can be the proud owner of this fine [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Jessi_Slaughter female dog.](Her ass will land in there just as soon as Jessica admits to being sexually abused in a [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Shrinks therapy]session.)
