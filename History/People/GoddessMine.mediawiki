GoddessMine maintains a website and a [[LiveJournal]] page, in which she brags about the tributes she receives from retarded losers around the globe and gives instructions on how one can start worshiping her. She has a heightened sense of self-importance which stretches far beyond any imaginable notion of what she is truly worth in reality, which is why she needs to be put back in her place. For instance, she thinks having a 3.8 GPA as a fluffy Arts major makes her an intellectual goddess. Consequently, she will soon find out what true genius is when her life is flipped turned upside down, and I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there, I'll tell you how she became the princess of a town called fail.

Recently, GoddessMine caught Anonymous' attention. The attempt at Dox gathering initial proved to be unfruitful, probably because, being into BDSM, she already has to hide her info from a fucking legion of stalkers and other retarded losers, some of them probably furries. However, once Anonymous uncovered a domain the bitch had purchased without proxy and did not develop (goddessmine.com), her dox were finally revealed. Cross-references with a Xanga page made to mock GoddessMine, some of Julie's posts on [http://anonym.to/http://72.14.205.104/search?q=cache:faFdeFWX8tsJ:www.complaintsboard.com/search/ll/page/3044+%22julie+abra%22&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=5&gl=us&client=firefox-a complaintsboard.com] as well as the immediate flurry of profile closures and deletions perpetrated by her upon the appearance of this information on /b/, has been taken by Anonymous as sufficient confirmation of its veracity.

After being warned about the current threat by one of her loyal subjects, she decided to make her Livejournal friend-only.

The verification of her phone number and address, once the two were found in the white pages, was very cleverly done. Quoting Anonymous: 

    AHAHAHA i called her 
    her: "Hello?" 
    Anon: "Godessmine?" 
    Her: "yea- Who is this?" 
    Anon: "Gotcha" 

Yet more proof was obtained by other Anonymous [http://anonym.to/http://rapidshare.com/files/79600401/santanan.mp3.html calling the number]: "Police officer answered the phone, said that we couldn't talk to Julie because he's investigating. Inadvertently confirmed that it was her number though."

A search on the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing website reveals three Julie Fischers. Fortunately, middle names are listed, and lulz are pending.

Fischer, Julie Abra (A FUCKING POKEMON) shows two approved applications for "Emergency 30-Day Substitute Teaching Permit". One expires 2.2008, and the other on 2.2009.

From the website: "To renew this permit, the holder needs to submit an application form and fee through his or her employing school district or county office of education, or directly to the Commission office."

Copypasta has been written to send to the parents, if dox can be gotten: Attention parents of Chatsworth Hills Academy:

It has come to the attention of a concerned organization that there is something going on in your child’s school that you should be aware of. There is a teacher teaching kindergarten there by the name of Julie Abra Fischer who has been running an internet dominatrix business in her spare time. Ms. Fischer proudly proclaims on her website that “money gets me wet” and that she is interested in things such as “cbt (cock and ball torture)” and blackmail. This concerned organization, which would prefer to remain anonymous, has taken action against Ms. Fischer, including making sure her website is taken down and that she has been reported to the IRS for tax evasion, however, we felt that you, as parents at Chatsworth Hills Academy, have the right to know that this is going on. We understand that you value your children’s safety and the quality of the education they are getting. Because of this we believe you have the right to know about Ms. Fischer’s transgressions.

Sincerely, Anonymous

=Food for Thought=

This is a list of establishments around her that offer take-out food, in case anyone wants to get some lulz from sending her shit she didn't order to waste her money. (Very simple prank; all the better to be used on pseudo-intellectual cyber-prostitutes.) Also, El Monte is apparently the Papa John's capital of the world.

Dominos - (626) 448-3030 Some resturants use caller ID, bad idea as they'll see non-local area codes and get suspicious, although VoIP services like Vonage let you choose your own area code.

=Grad School=

It WILL result in lulz if someone was to contact the grad schools she may be applying to and informing them about her website, etc. http://img297.imageshack.us/img297/6599/goddessminetp4.png

=IRS=
As of ~8:50am PST, she has been reported to the IRS for income tax evasion.

=SiteCube=
After Anonymous beat the shit out of her bandwidth, her host closed her page. We will wait for the new month to strike.

=Why Anonymous is Completely Justified=
While some may question the morality of many raids, THIS one had a solid foundation. Read, from Julie's own site:

Every boypussy wants something a little different, and the all-knowing Goddess understands this. While the following are basic charges for My sessions, every other kink or freakish fetish you want included is an added cost, to be determined whenever fuckwads. And remember: an initial tribute along with an application is required before any discussion of services begin!

Her Rates

    15 min session online chat - $40 
    15 min session w/phone - $50 
    15 min session online w/cam - $70 
    15 min session w/ phone & cam - $80 

    30 min session online chat - $75 
    30 min session w/ phone - $95 
    30 min session online w/ cam - $130 
    30 min session w/ phone & cam - $150 

No further explanation is deemed necessary, except for this display of narcissism. LOL at bulimic too.


Also, the real reason anon is justified is that the bitch came on /b/ and provoked us and said she could beat us, that we would never win over her.

That, above all else, is the reason to bury this bitch as far into the ground as we can.
