=Background=

[[File:Teaparty.jpg]]

A picture depicting a well-known Anonymous slogan is being used by the [http://anonym.to/?http://oregonteaparty.ning.com/ Oregon Tea Party] appeared on <strike>/b/</strike> reddit.

As of right now, we have the element of surprise since no actions have been launched against the Oregon Tea Party.  We must move quickly and deliberately to avoid white knights, legal B.S. (which is very likely given the target), and the mass failure of /b/.

==Reports of Personal Army Attempt==
Some have claimed that this is a clever attempt at getting anon to be a political machine.  However, the [http://tinyurl.com/26bghjb July 22nd Google Cache of the Oregon Tea Party profile on teapartypatriots] clearly shows otherwise:

=Strategy=
[[File:Inwwr.png|right|200px|thumb|Also post this everywhar]]
# Compile dox on members, especially leaders, of the Oregon Tea Party.  Use their [http://www.facebook.com/OregonTeaParty?ref=search facebook] page.
# Proceed to [[Ruination]] and [[Ruin Life Tactics/Free Shit]] to fuck with them. One way to find the base of their operations is to buy a bumper sticker from them, and use the return address.
# Spam their facebook profile and ning site
## More subtly, post things that are batshit insane yet still within their scope (i.e., 9/11 conspiracy, birther shit, obama=community nazi jew, racism a la Carlos Mencia, etc)
## Those lemon party posters could be put you good use here... just claim to be something similar to the tea party and offer to form an alliance.  Maybe say that the Lemon Party is more lobby oriented and has collected funding from groups such as the NRA.  That'll get them to click the link...
# Create fake accounts on social networks and create information campaigns similar to BPGlobalPR on the evil twitter.

==Subversion==
[[File:Teapartycomix.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Not racist at all]]

I remember reading about the Tea Party Comix issue and how the creator denies they are racist despite it being almost obvious. This view is also held by many Tea Baggers and they are completely oblivious to the racist undertones as long as they believe those "DAMN LIBERAL" are banning free speech. (pic related, you can see more of them at http://its.goofyti.me/u/http://www.ep.tc/tea-party-comix/)

So here's the plan. Get some pens and paper out and start making "Tea Party Comix" or see about getting some of your drawfag friends to help you out. You don't even need to be good at making comics, just make images of the blackest Obama you can make (big lips and everything)being put in his place by a white character, but stay away from more obvious racist things like watermelon or fried chicken. If you are subtle enough, it'll look to the tea-baggers that it's just bashing liberals while to the rest of the nation it'll look like it was produced by the Klan.

The next step is to distribute them. Get them printed up (either at home or if you can, a print shop) and bring them to your local tea-party rally. Get dressed in a cap, sunglasses and blue jeans (you've got to look the part) and start telling people that you've got Tea Party Comix that the liberals and Obama banned. Make it seem like he was infringing on their free speech.

With luck, they'll all look like a bunch of crackers and not even know it.

=Primary Objectives=
The main goal of this raid (as well as others) is to extract lulz from rage-prone targets.  None are so prone to the lulzy combination of rage and failure as the Tea Party.  In addition this raid will seek reparations for an egregious breach of internet protocol -- theft of memes for personal profit.
A useful side goal would be to make a crack link to fake an invite to there site?

To these ends, we will seek the ruination of both the Oregon Tea Party and all other chapters that choose to become involved.  We will attack the following targets simultaneously:

==OTP you so lulzy==

Operate in lulzy manner in the name of the tea party, they want to be associated? we'll associate the shit out of them WAT

Raids are now in the name of OTP, retroactively from now WATWAT

Contact local news in oregan, their board is locked makes them look suspicious dont it? :)

'''Nigger, we have no idea what you're talking about'''  Explain it clearly or not at all.  kthxbai.  +1

He's saying all raids from now on should be in their name. Old raids should be blamed on them. Call Oregon news stations or newspapers and report them for the raids. Their locked site makes them look suspicious.

'''DO NOT FUCKING LOIC'''
Don't bother with anything of the sort.  For one thing Ning is HUEG (think: mini facebook), and for another the Oregon Tea Party is changing hosting because Ning is run by a 'radical liberal' (lolwut).

Starting immediately, brave volunteers are to start creating accounts and integrating into the masses.  Post legitimate comments (don't troll yet) and create ''multiple fucking accouts'' because you '''will''' get b&.

Those with the proper knowledge and tools should also begin immediate pentesting.  Our objective should be to deface the page with whatever content we think will offend them (gay nigger porn?).

==Members==

<strike>[http://anonym.to/http://oregonteaparty.ning.com/profiles/members/ Here]</strike> is a link of registered members.  We need to seek out those with decent dox and proceed to ruination.  Accounts with unusual names and pictures are the most likely to succeed.  Post successfully doxed members in the appropriate section below.

'''NOTE''':  Refer to Operation Jewgold for properly-run personal raids.

===Geoff Ludt===
Creator and webmaster of the page.  Moar dox are needed, but here is his page on the site: <strike>[http://anonym.to/?http://oregonteaparty.ning.com/profile/GeoffLudt]</strike> [Invite only.] 
Given that he shoop'd his profile picture, it's not unlikely that he is also responsible for the legion pic.

'''UPDATE''':  A brave anon has provided preliminary dox.  Anon should try to guess his gmail password and root through his mail for dirt.  Social engineering calls should also be made to dig up further dox.

'''UPDATE 2''':  The jew has a business webpage.  Pentests should start immediately.
