Cheyenne Cherry is a 17-year-old nigger who put her "friend's" cat in the oven, while high on PCP. She then left to give blowjays to all the cute boys.

IMPORTANT!!!!!! SOMEONE FROM GENEVA, ALABAMA KNOWING THIS BITCH HERE?
She seems to be a heavy supporter of bitchslap Cheyenne and not just someone trolling around. Here some examples of her 'nice' comments on ErickwitNok's youtube vid's
'Girl Burns Kitten Alive In An Oven As "Practical Joke" and 'Kitten Killer Cheyenne Cherry Sentenced To One Year In Jail'
recon1289  
Cherry did a cool thing﻿ microwaving the kitten..... I hope she does many more. Kill all kittens and let God sort them out
recon1289  
Hell you would, your as﻿ gutless as most people. Hope Cherry kills more kittens in the microwave, just for you
recon1289 
and after she gets out, she can﻿ microwave all the kittens she wants.
recon1289  
it is only a kitten you﻿ dope, what about poor Cherry
recon1289  
You just don't like anyone with a taste for﻿ kittens.... lol 
I am going to have a kitten beaten and cooked up special in your memory, you silly ass.
recon1289
speaking of frying somthing
Hey I'm in Lao's now and they eat cat here. It is amazing to watch them prepare the cat and any animal for eating. You have to torment the caged animal before you physically beat it to death. It is very difficult to watch from the american perspective (but when in Rome do as the Romans)
I am told it gives more flavor to the meat, personally I can't tell the differance in the taste of the meat between a tortured animal and non﻿ tortured.... Its just meat!
recon1289 
I think she is going to screw over lots more kittens..... This is so cool. All the upset texting isn't going to prevent﻿ anouther kitten from meeting a microwave... all this discussion should actually encourage more animal abuse.

THIS FEMALE WASTE SEEMS TO LIVE IN THE ABOVE MENTIONED CITY AND HAD DURING THE LAST SUMMER SOME FUSS WITH THE LOCAL LIBRARIAN AND THE LORD MAYOR, SOMEONE RECOGNIZES HER? 
Here is her Youtube Account and Webpage:

She basically encourages other twisted waste to follow Cherry's example

Address: 680 or 710 Tinton Ave (possibly the address she lived at when she was roommates with the person whose cat she cooked).
Note: the Tinton Avenue address was the place where she burnt the kitten, and it is believed that the owner was her former roommate/neighbor, meaning she doesn't live there anymore. It's also noted in the news report that she was placed in protective custody with her mother until the trial, meaning she wouldn't be where she normally lives.

===Her Possible Location===

<u>Best Match for Address, it's where the roasting took place.</u>

'''710 Tinton Ave, New York, NY 10455'''

<u>'''NOTE: Address below is unconfirmed but not likely. "C" is for "Cynthia".  "C" is also for "Cloaca".'''</u>

Here is a picture from her MySpace:

[[File:location2.jpg]]

Here is the same place on Google Maps:

[[File:Picture4-1.png]]

Here is the aerial view:

[[File:Picture5-1.png]]

Thus, we can use the objects available in MySpace image to triangulate a positive ID on the location of the source.
Here is the building from which the picture was taken:
http://anonym.to/http://i300.photobucket.com/albums/nn33/AnonFlierDump/Picture7.png

Edit: The actual building might be the one with 720 next to it, to the left of the highlighted building as the triangular building can be seen in shot and the elevated road [?] can be seen parallel to the building not perpendicular.

Note that the 710 Tinton address may be connected to Leake and Watts.  This is a private corporation that is "dedicated to strengthening resources for troubled children" (read:  niggahs).  According to a NY Daily News post,they are CCC's "facility."  [http://www.nydailynews.com/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=61548&start=40&tstart=0]  At leakeandwatts.org it says LW provides a "supervised independent living program" that is transitional living for adolescents 17 through 21.  LW operates 11 apartments for 22 residents.  According to the poster, Cherry, the 14 year old accomplice, and the kitten's owner were all under custody or students or whatever at Leake and Watts and that's how they knew each other and how two 17 year olds happened to be "roommates."  So . . . does anyone know anyone, who works at Leake and Watts, or knows them, and could check this out?
