After South Park did an episode about the Muslim sensitivities to depictions of their prophet, concealing him in a bear suit to either avoid depictions (or else imply that Muhammad was a furry), the Muslims then attempted to imitate the characterize of themselves, from the same show they were protesting, apparently attempting to out-do The Onion.  Regardless, they appear to be incredible lulz cows, and incredibly easy to milk at that.  Posts of Muhammad being defecated on by a pig, posted on one of their forum, can result on much butthurt.

The plan? Drive Muslims everywhere into a shittstorm.  The target?  All Muslim internet sites.  Keep in mind that trolling them the old fashioned way will probably be a better method, since if you can get US-hosted websites to start putting out a lot of death threats--being that the authorities are already biased against them--their hosts might take the website itself down for you, or they might actually get into legal trouble.  Should the raid have a definite date? Talk in IRC.

* TO DO LIST:
# We need specific plans for raids. Copypasta and images that can be posted on /b/ and elsewhere to get people to act.
# Maybe come up with specific dates for certain raids
# Add more websites to raid
# Add more info about Islam, things that will make Muslims butthurt
# There are websites out there where you can order free Qurans and Islamic books etc. find them, add them to the wiki and they might come in handy.
# Create facebook groups that are pro-Islam and anti-Free speech
# Create facebook groups that are anti-Islam and pro-Free speech
# ''Create Last Measure clone with images from this raid. Link it on Islamist forums.'' HOLY FUCK THIS IDEA IS AWESOME '''done, see below'''
# Create, and mass spread a facebook event for people to change their profile pics to a not so nice depiction of Muhammid for free speech.  Obviously can't be too bad, or facebook will take down the pics.

==Youtube==
Youtube is generally a pretty lulzy target, because you can hear and see their reactions (and as we all know, reading what they write is near impossible, since their brain is too full of Qur'an too fit a proper knowledge of English).

===Creating Videos #1===
See the pictures at the bottom of the page, or on the links below. Put them to lulzy music. Upload them. Post onto islamic forums and blogs.  Try setting them as replies to Islamic videos.

====Notes====
* '''Important:''' If you do this with your main account, you will waste a perfectly good main account. YouTube will take it off as soon as they find it, and they will ban the account used to post it. It doesn't hurt to use a proxy, either. <br>
* '''For great lulz:''' Post a bunch of videos like this, set them ALL to private, then unprivate them all at the same time (you should have tons up, also spread them out over several accounts so that they can't get rid of them all as easily as if they were on one account. Also, idea taken from the YouTube Porn raid thingy).
* '''Organization:''' For help and to direct your efforts, there are several IRC channels available. For general raid channels, use [irc://irc.partyvan.info/#insurgency #insurgency (Helldive)] & [irc://irc.anonnet.org/#islamichan #islamichan (AnonNet)]. For YouTube trolling, use [irc://irc.anonnet.org/#jihad #jihad (AnonNet)]. Other channels worth mentioning include [irc://irc.anonnet.org/#raidchan #raidchan (AnonNet)] and [irc://irc.partyvan.info/#prank #prank (Helldive)]. Finally, any discussion regarding this w/i/ki article can be taken to [irc://irc.partyvan.info/#partyvan #partyvan (Helldive)], which is the general administration channel. Helldive & AnonNet, while unaffiliated, are both supporting this raid. Attempts to cause drama between the different networks will NOT be tolerated by either.
* '''Example video:''' BALEETED

===Video Sabotage===
Try flagging everything on Muslim youtube channels/users for hatred.  If we can get their videos down, it could drive them crazy-er.

* [http://anonym.to/http://www.youtube.com/user/revolutionmuslims RevolutionMuslims]

===Creating Videos #2===
Record yourself doing this:<br><br>

# Acquire plush toy
# Call it "Muhammad"
# Film it being fucked or killed or humiliated in general
# Upload to video websites
# ???????
# PROFIT!

==General Islamic Websites==
Besides the obvious, there are a number of possible trolling methods.  One group is posting bacon (superdoublebad in Islam is pig) on their forums (see [irc://irc.anonnet.org/#DURKA #DURKA on irc.anonnet.org]).  Also, use trolling to incite them to speak violently.  When they personally threaten you or anyone else, screencap, copypaste, and report the whole thing to the United States authorities, as well as their web host.

==Newsreap==
Following the airing of the censored episode of South Park, brave anons have been riding all corners of the internets looking for muslims to troll and Islamic websites to destroy--around 8 websites have been taken down, and about ten websites were decimated or covered with pictures of Muhammed and a nice big juicy cock.  However, only so much rage can be extracted from those particular communities; in the same way that the non-depiction of Muhammad brought about massive rage from many Muslims, imagine what a widely reported, much more explicit invitation to rage would do?

We shall spread our lulz around the world. We will massively email EVERY SINGLE news channel that wants cheap ratings, taking the position of defenders of freedom and liberty--mostly because this will piss of Muslims more than anything.  The emails need to be over-dramatic and moralfag-sounding, because that gains the most media attention.  Remove this paragraph when we get news coverage.

# Take the following copypasta.
# Spam mail it to the [http://anonym.to/?http://pastebay.com/95141 following emails]
# Get your fellow anon to do the same (A mail bomber is being made as we speak).
# Every single news channel that matters will soon report on the massive amount of anger the censorship of South Park has created.

===The Copypasta===
<pre>
SUBJECT: Censorship and Freedom of Speech

Hello, Anonymous here.

We have a problem. You may have heard about recent events that involve our freedom of speech.
Two Muslims from New York City threatened the makers of a popular TV show, when they heard a picture of Muhammad was going to be used in that same show.
This very same episode also contained satire about Christianity, Buddhism, Judaism and virtually every other religion in existence.

Right before the episode was aired, Comedy Central decided to censor anything that had to do with the Islam and Muhammad.<br>
  For some reason, they decided Islam deserved a special treatment--it is the only religion that may not be ridiculed. <br>
 Comedy Central decided TWO (!) threats was enough to give up on freedom of speech.

This is a message to every single network channel out there.
NEVER give up on your rights. NEVER allow FEAR and HATE to take over.
Humanity is fed up with these extremist views. It is time for everyone to take a stand.
Don't ever let anyone take away the rights our ancestors have fought for.

1. Killing and annihilating them either by gunning them down, bombing them, or striking their necks with swords or knives
2. Crucifying them, i.e. nailing them on a tree or a pole, and let them die a slow excruciating death
3. Cutting off from opposite sides their hands and feet with axes, swords or guns, and let them wander off until death comes to them.

{{Quote|This matter is about the Western concept of liberalization of society, where freedom of expression/speech is elevated above all other values systems, including upholding and enjoining Right and Forbidding Wrong. What Westerners don't want to admit is that liberalization is NOT a means to measure right and wrong. Rather, its AMORAL. The one who propagates evil has just as much right than the one who propagates Right. Hitler came to power in a liberalized, secular democracy in Germany. The Indian riots and their perpetrators' immunity occurred in liberalized India. And then Westerners are surprised when evil prevails, like Bush's War on Terror, or the Financial crisis, or the spread of drug culture, the spread of promiscuity, and on and on.
And one of the primary causes for liberalization is for increased trade and commerce- profit. The fewer barriers and limitations on human relations, the more profit a few groups of people can benefit, but the more evil and corruption that is spread. Glen Beck and FOX news with their lies and slander are rich and powerful in a liberalized society. To no surprise, this same concept rises throughout human history, where the greed of a few powerful people leads to the corruption of all society.

The South Park people, Stone and PArker, are admittedly libertarians. They admit they don't recognize any value or moral standard and thus their work is full of bigotry, stereotypes, denigration, ecspecially towards racial and ethnic minorities.

Islam does not accept liberalization and denigration of humanity. Evil cannot be granted power. Nor is profit and greed justification for the license for evil and immorality. Moreover, the West is currently engaging in a world war against Islam. It uses military forces to invade, occupy, overthrow, assasinate, and rebuild Muslim lands for its own interests. Western powers manipulate and control Muslim trade and business, seeking to harness resources and commerce for their own interests. This is evident in the economies of most Muslim countries. They are dominated by Western economies and Muslim wealth is invested and kept in Western banks. Western law is elevated to determine relations and constitutions in the Muslim world and between the West and the Muslim world. Western culture is propagated through proxies that produce liberalized and secularized cultures to propagate to Muslims (Lebanon, Egypt, Turkey, Tunisia, etc). This ongoing war is the reality in which the Muslim people try to hold onto Islam. This South Park cartoon is part of the propaganda of th is war, and its part of the struggle by the West to dominatie Muslims.|[http://anonym.to/?http://forums.islamicawakening.com/f18/south-park-plans-depict-prophet-muhammad-34763/index12.html#post349316 Abu Kamel], Thinking that the West is encroaching on Muslims when it's the other way around}}
