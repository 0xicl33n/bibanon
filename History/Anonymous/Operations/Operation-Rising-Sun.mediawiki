==Part 1==
A series of training videos for newfags on how to be 1337. This would include how networking works, what tools we use, maybe some basic programming, some guidelines on how not to be a fag, etc. If you don't know the information contained in these videos, you'll be b&. Of course, all this is available on the wiki, but like all wikis, it's not the best method for teaching.

<div style='width: 49%; float: left; margin-right: 1%;'>
==Part 2==
We'd take all the /i/s and make them very hard to find. i.e. They'd be listed on Google as something they're not, or not listed at all, and we'd try to keep the ED articles that point to the /i/s also hard to get to. 
</div>
<div style='width: 49%; float: left;'>
==Part 3==
Mods ban fags. It's already done some, but I mean people should literally be banned for being stupid. inb4 I'm banned.

==Information==
* '''/i/'''
** [http://rockstararmy.com/i/res/1546.html RockStarArmy]
* '''IRC'''
** [irc://irc.helldive.org/insurgency #insurgency]
** Make another specific channel if there is enough interest

__ToC__
=Plans=
This is fairly broad, so we will break down the goal into bits.  The videos will deal largely with information on the wiki, and are creative and not dependent on chan administrators, therefor they will be first on the list here.

==Videos==
Please check the wiki (protip: we have a search function) to find information, lest you have to re-invent the wheel when making the videos.

===What they will cover===
[[File:Droogs.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Probably more appropriate than the likeness of a 16th century religious fascist]]
* Some basic shit you should know before you watch the other videos, like some info on /i/ and how to act on here without looking like a faggot
* Raids that are forbidden and why
* Attack methods (Trolling, denial of service, gathering dox, using dox)
* Basic tutorial on using IRC, like clients, commands, etc.
* Using the wiki
* Specific technical issues
** Networking
** ''Unbiased'' overview of operating systems
** Social engineering? It'd be hard, because it's basically a psychology course.
** Basic HTML / JavaScript
** Maybe some overview of cell phone tech? I can see a lot of /i/ moving into the smartphone department.

===What we need===
[[File:128019199570.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Then again, maybe the Fawkes mask just looks cooler than anything relevant?]]
They should be fairly sleek, and well-formatted.  We need to get some generic screens to have up when someone is speaking (think: CNN).  We also need:

* Someone to speak through the videos (preferably with a British accent)
** Preferably someone with a green screen who can film themselves
* Someone who can edit together the videos.
* Generic screens for speaking (green screen-compatible if we use one)
* A place to host the videos

====If we film a person====
If we do make these videos of actual people, instead of the cliche Fawkes mask thing, how about one of these:

* Turban
** or Balaclava
* Suit
* Droog mask/outfit (pic related)

==New /i/ rules==
The following are some potential new rules for sites hosting /i/ boards

* Talking about /i/ outside of /i/ is strictly forbidden. Sentence will be a 5-day ban. (not that we can enforce this, it's more symbolic.)
* Requesting a PA raid will get you a week-long ban and your IP dropped.
* Being a moralfag will get you a week-long ban.
* Asking for a raid on moral reasons will get you a week-long ban and your IP dropped. Unless it involves kittens.
* Suggesting Anonymous has a reputation to protect will get you a 4-day ban.
* Being a fag for reasons that don't fall under the above rules will result in a ban with a length at the discretion of the mods.
