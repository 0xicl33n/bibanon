Here are some simple copypasta to tell CNN.  Feel free to make your own, or even post some here.  Keep in mind that you should tweak each one before using it, so that they don't know that we're all reading off of a script.

Hello!?  I'd like to report an error in the voting machines..  I've been following the campaign of future president Barack Obama VERY CLOSELY since the primaries, and finally got the chance to vote, but when I clicked on Obama.. It chose McCain!  I'm terribly confused about what In ought to do, can you help me?

=Pissed off=
I just tried to vote on one of these confangled tough screen pieces of shit, and it tallied my vote under McCain instead of Obama!  WHAT DO I DO??!?

=Wat=
Ummm..  I tried to vote for McCain, but it went to Ralph Nader.  What gives?  Can you help me?
