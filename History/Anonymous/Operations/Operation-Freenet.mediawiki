Apparently, some [http://iwf.org.uk/ IRL idiots] decided that it would be a good idea to try and censor wikipedia, because of the virgin killer's album (incidentally, this is what caused the last 420chan outage).  And though no one could have possibly thought that this could turn out badly...  Shit has hit the fan.  This page will hold instructions on how to violate the IWF's loli ass.

=Simple Instructions (old)=
'''When:''' 11/12/2008 @ 5pm GMT
'''Where:''' Everywhere
'''Method:''' DDoS
'''Target:''' IWF

# Start up either [[Low Orbit Ion Cannon]] or [[PyRAEP/UDP]]
# Put 82.109.189.34 as the target
# DDoS at exactly 5pm GMT on 11/12/2008 (NB: this is 5pm in the UK, not 6pm or 4pm because we are no longer in British Summer Time/Daylight Saving Time, If you're not sure what your timezone is or your to lazy to buy a clock, Goto http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/ for official GMT)

=Online Targets=
==Websites==
Since the IWF website uses such a shitty captcha system, it is easy to flood their website with thousands of fake reports.

Here is a PHP script which floods their site with reports:
http://parasolus.nfshost.com/iwf_flood.phps

Feel free to add more websites that it reports, and email addresses. It's fairly self explanatory.

TO RUN THE SCRIPT:
1. Save the script as flood.php on your computer
2. Download and install Glossword WAMP, it will allow you to run PHP scripts on your computer: http://preview.tinyurl.com/5g3t2o
3. Move the PHP file to the correct folder (see the readme files for Glossword)
4. Open the file with your browser and it is now flooding the IWF website

If you want the script to use TOR, you have to replace this line:

// curl_setopt($t, CURLOPT_PROXY, '127.0.0.1:8118'); uncomment to use Tor

with this:

curl_setopt($t, CURLOPT_PROXY, '127.0.0.1:8118');

And have TOR running. If you use TOR be sure to change your IP address every few minutes so they don't catch on.

Have fun
