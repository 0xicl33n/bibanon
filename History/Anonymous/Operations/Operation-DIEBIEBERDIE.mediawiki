Justin Bieber has been on /i/'s radar for a long time. While there have been many raids suggested (DDoS, spam, etc.) all of them failed due to fail and also due to him being protected by jews. This raid is certain to cause lulz where Bieber's fans usually look for information or hang up (fansites, official Twitter, Facebook, etc.) and it's also going to cause lulz for the thousands of people who unexpectedly pick up troll music posing as Justin Bieber from a music store.

=Plan=
*We need to try to get the passwords to the accounts that Justin Bieber or his management control.
*We need to replace CD's in stores such as Wal-Mart with similar CD's containing troll music.
*We need people to freak out over a fake death or controversy over Justin Bieber.
*Most of all, we need to troll the fuck out of them.
