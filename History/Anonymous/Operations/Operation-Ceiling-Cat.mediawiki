===From Wikipedia:===
Undertaken under the Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development (FP7 - Science in Society) some multidisciplinary and mission oriented mass surveillance activities (for example <br>INDECT and HIDE) are funded by the European Commission in association with industrial partners.<br>
Search Wikinews Wikinews has related news: Listening to you at last: EU plans to tap cell phones<br>

The INDECT Project ("Intelligent information system supporting observation, searching and detection for security of citizens in urban environment")<br>
develops a intelligent urban environment observation system to register and exchange operational data for the automatic detection, recognition and intelligent processing of all information of abnormal behaviour or violence.<br><br>

The main expected results of the INDECT project are:<br>

 implementation of a distributed computer system that is capable of acquisition,
 storage and effective sharing on demand of the data
 devices used for mobile object tracking
 a search engine for fast detection of persons and documents based on watermarking technology used for semantic search<br>
 agents assigned to continuous and automatic monitoring of public resources such as '''CCTV, websites, internet forums, usenet newsgroups, file servers, P2P networks and individual computer systems'''

The consortium HIDE ("Homeland Security, Biometric Identification & Personal Detection Ethics"), <br>
devoted to monitoring the ethical and privacy implications of biometrics and personal detection technologies and <br>
promoted by the European Commission develops ADABTS ("Automatic Detection of Abnormal Behaviour and Threats in crowded Spaces"), <br>
a low-cost pro-active surveillance system to detect potential abnormal behaviour in crowded spaces.<br>

==Summary==
'''TL:DR WARNING'''

All-round system for European Homeland Security

In Wuppertal, there is resistance against University participating in the the EU monitoring project INDECT. <br>

Intelligent information system to have surveillance, search and recognition in order to protect the safety of citizens in Urban Areas, Project INDECT, created by the European Police forces, 
<br>along with companies and univerities, in consortium with partners from 10 leading surveillance techology firms from Germany and Austria.  <br>

INDECT is one of 45 projects in the European Security Research Programme. <br>

The aim of the project, which European data protection officials have violently criticized, is to develop an all-round system for "data-mining".  <br>
The range of INDECT is immense, registration and exchange of data, collection of multimedia content, intelligent processing of data,  <br>
automated threat detection, and detection of "suspicious behaviour",  <br>
including that present on the Internet.  <br>
INDECT is an attempt to develop a platform that combines both hardware and software methods in a single prototype,  <br>
and is embeded in the shift of police work to a more "intelligence-led" and "pro-active" approach,  <br>
which was far more reserved. (Information is considered "key" in fighting crime).  <br>
Many companies are developing this software for predicting and analyzing the risks of crimes (Knowing today what tomorrow will bring).  <br>
INDECT wants the greatest possible access to data, regardless of ethics. <br>

>EU Member states will provide INDECT with technology to ensure that decisons of public safety are based on the maximum amount of information available <br>

Target Group: "Homeland Security Services" <br>
The European Security Research Programme was first issued as a separate focus in the 7th Research Framework Programme 2007-20013 (FP7),  <br>
and began with the European Security Research Conference in Berlin under Germany's EU Presidency.  <br>
The invitation to the conference campaigned for "new, technology-oriented perspectives for Europe to combat international terrorism and other threats".  
<br>45 projects are expected to provide new tools for civilian and military security by 2013. <br>

INDECT is divided into 10 "Work Packages", which include delivery of data by different sensors,  <br>
surveillance of the internet, processing and analysis of data, multimedia applications,  <br>
and security management and testing environments.  <br>
The primary target group will be Homeland Security Services and police, followed by local communities, industry partners, <br>
and research institutes. European citizens are only mentioned as benefiting from results in third place.  <br>
INDECT plans a "rich and compregensive set" of market and <s>investment studies</s>'''cheap slaves''',  <br>
together with a roadmap for technological implementation of the results.  <br>
In addiction, it will strengthen co-operation with "non-European developed countries", notably the United States. <br>

The five year project, with a budget of almost '''15 million euro''', is '''under the direction of the AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow (Poland).''' <br>
Research on INDECT is associated with the production of various materials,  <br>
including posters, brochurs, and regular updates of the website.  <br>
An INDECT promotional video has been created for the presentation of interim results.  <br>
The film which will be used all through the prject was first shown at the annual Security Research Conference in Stockholm under the Swedish Presidency. <br>

The exact number of INDECT project partners is opaque.  <br>
The Hungarian Foundation's "overt difference" after bankruptcy would have reduced the group  <br>
to 18. From Germany, InnoTec DATA, PSI Transcom and the Institute of Control Engineering in Department E of the University of Wuppertal are involved with it. <br>
Even the Federal Criminal Police Office is involved, though notice of this is missing in some publications.  <br>
Also in the boat are the police forces of Poland and Ireland, who are managed as "End Users".  <br>
The Northern Ireland Police service have an interest in the "preventation" and "detection of crime".  <br>
The Polish General Police Headquarters requests that INDECT should be developed as an explicitly new platform, as alternatives to existing systems are obsolete: <br>
>We expect INDECT to be a big step forward within the area of intelligence gathering and surveillance technology,  <br>
solving unsolved problems and utilizing resources available now and in the near future.
-GPH, Poland <br>

For the definition of suspicious behaviour that will be traced using INDECT,  <br>
several hundred Polish police officers were questioned. The majority see "loitering",  <br>
"looking around", and long stays near doors as suspicious.  <br>
Talk is about a university for placement of several test installations as a result of INDECT.  <br>
15 nodes should be used for a demonstration of a distributed computer system for the intelligent processing of data,  <br>
including weatherproof miniature computers with cameras, <br>
microphones, <br>
biometric sensors,  <br>
mobile indentification,  <br>
transmission scanners,  <br>
monitors, <br>
GPS,  <br>
microtransmitters, <br>
and RFID tags.  <br>

Telepolis learned from PSI Transcom that it is expected to field test only in the last year of the project. <br>
>The tests are to run in the fifth year, and will take place on the premises of partners.  <br>
It was established in the project plan to obtain the written consent of all parties involved,  <br>
and additional information will be distributed, and information booths are to be set up on the partner site. <br>

It was not clear according to Coward "whether the project partners can 'successfully define unusual'". The technology for INDECT is currently present   <br>
at "any point prior to immediate use".

FOUR GERMAN PARTNERS OF INDECT <br>
The Berlin company PSI Transcom controls INDECTS platform for analysis of video and audio data, which will guarantee features for control measures,  <br>
resource management, and data archiving. <br>
and data archiving. The application of the PSI "safety and the environment" is directed primarily to operators of so-called "critical infrastructure"  <br>
to "intelligent automation of surveillance". The platform contains Moreover,  <br>
a geo-referenced visualization, alarms and operational plans, <br>
weather services, on-board computer systems for vehicles, automatic transfer of the vehicle position,  <br>
communication interfaces to telephone, radio, GSM, TETRA, Wi-Fi and external systems.  <br>
The invitation to cooperate in the PSI to INDECT was allegedly pronounced on the European Security Conference 2007 on the part of the University of Krakow. <br>
At the conference, the company was present as an exhibitor.

InnoTec DATA from Bad Zwischenahn, also German partner in INDECT developed digital monitoring systems for data collection and transmission  <br>
and is proud of a "technology lead of more than six years." Applications of Innotec aimed at discounters chains and establishments  <br>
such as the bakery equipment Bäko for video surveillance of their employees.  <br>
The company recently made a GTS module for satellite positioning and positioning themselves aware of,  <br>
the Falcon was taken from one. The little black box can location of cars, people or objects,  <br>
or the temperature in a truck and transferred the "complete control of the goods" to ensure a. The module will be available soon or pocket knife key ring as.  <br>
Speaking to the press said Innotec, "in close contact with international intelligence agencies and security authorities to stand."  <br>
According to PSI Project Manager Zoltán Nagy Innotecs contribution applies to INDECT primarily on homeland security services. "

As Funded Project , the University of Wuppertal 706 000 € from the EU for research on INDECT receive.  <br>
Under Line Prof. Dr.-Ing. Bernd Tibken will contribute an "Assistant Professor", six PhD <s>students</s>slaves, 20 bachelor's and master's <s>students</s>slaves and three employees in it.  <br>

Focus is a watermarking technology that builds on a last in the 10 years in collaboration with Prof. Tibken procedures developed.  <br>
This could, according Tibken semantic search engines are optimized to search for people and documents, inter alia, video and audio data, the Internet or scanned handwritten texts.  <br>
In the INDECT project description we find the note that it also discussion forums, Usenet groups, file server, <br>
P2P networks as well as "Individual computer systems" would be ransacked.

The search engines are to create more simple search strategies to eliminate so far high failure rates,  <br>
and manage large amounts of data. According to Prof. Tibken could about "the Sicken of a knife will be detected",  <br>
the automated comparison of data could also protect against theft of intellectual property.  <br>

Tibken explained that INDECT was inspired by the "defense of terrorist attacks". In addition,  <br>
the project was well suited to be placed in position against child pornography. The watermarking technology from Wuppertal could help to prevent data scandals. <br>
Terms of any output from European police forces have INDECT to child pornography, for example, the German Federal Criminal Office. <br>

The involvement of Federal Criminal INDECT, however, is nebulous.  <br>
With extensive new investigative skills using new technologies, the Authority is likely very interested in all the outputs of INDECT have.  <br>
The BKA (German CIA) had 2005 in the "European Security Research Advisory Board (ESRAB worked), the essential foundations for the current European security research program supplied.  <br>
Possibly, the BKA also brings his experience from the first failed Model for face recognition in 2006 of a railway station in Mainz. <br>
At that time the Criminal Institute of the BKA had tested various systems.  <br>
The Final Report complained that the project had great difficulties with lighting and a "conscious or unconscious cooperating behavior" of the target person should be sought.  <br>
A similar project was in 2008 in Berlin by the transit announced been to monitor the station Kottbusser gate with biometric facial recognition.

Student groups call for withdrawal of the University

Since November, and share student bodies of the University of Wuppertal critical look at the project.  <br>
In Poland, students met with professors involved.  <br>
The Wuppertal General Student Committee (AStA) had to Prof. Tibken  <br>
Special Session invited and to the presence of INDECT project coordinator 
Prof. Dziech passed by the AGH University in Krakow.  <br> <br>

The surcharge for Wuppertal from over 800 applications based probably on good relations with the Polish project.  <br>
His friendship with Tibken is based on a scientific exchange in 1994, when Dziech was appointed as a visiting professor at Wuppertal.  <br>
The participation of the University of Wuppertal is loud Tibken recognition,  <br>
since the project was in the European Union "highly regarded" and "a prestige effect in Wuppertal" have. <br>
In Wuppertal, is soon to take place a greater INDECT meeting.  <br>

The fuss about the participation in the university would hold INDECT contrast as small as possible: <br>
The rector had advised to update the site after numerous requests, so as not to give the image that the research should be kept secret.  <br>
Tibken promised the student council to make the research more transparent and to provide additional information within two weeks of his Website to ask.  <br>
Since then, however, nothing is happening there, even on repeated request of the professor was willing to Telepolis no opinion. <br>

Tibken does not believe that the university externally funded project could possibly provide new technical means for proactive monitoring of the population.  <br>
The problem is anyway not the research but the end user.  <br>
The European Union would be to develop their own systems no longer rely on software from the U.S.,  <br>
which could possibly contain backports and is therefore uncertain. Also Dziech project sees the future exploitation of results, <br>
as in dictatorships, outside the influence of the professors - an argument which has been criticized heavily in Wuppertal student parliament.  <br>
The alliance left and radical democratic students (lira) and the pirate university group demand <br>
Now that the university is not "continue to improve the surveillance state 'involved. In future there should be clear ethical guidelines for the fund raising. Even the student parliament is on one end of the participation of INDECT. <br>
A conversation about it with members of the Bureau and the student council has been denied by Rector and Dean's past.
<br>
'''Questionable Ethics Code'''

According to Prof. Tibken ethical issues INDECT project a great importance was acknowledged in this project application are at least 20 pages have been requested.  <br>
The EU Commission writes the establishment of an "Ethics Board" in all FP7 projects, <br>
in order to bring project results to European and national legislation into line.  <br>
Issues are involved in accordance with Patrick timid PSI Transcom privacy and data protection, representatives of the project.  <br>
As was ethics officer of Assistant Chief Constable with INDECT Drew Harris just named a British policeman,  <br>
chairman of the department of "Hate Crimes" at the British Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO).

The Code of Ethics INDECT comes from, inter alia, to the questionable assessment,  <br>
data from video surveillance are "less sensitive" than telephone monitoring. <br>
"Admittedly, an unfortunate statement," commented coward to Telepolis, however, is the "Ethics Board"  <br>
no institution of the European Commission and should not evaluate "the police work in the coming years and decades."  <br>
The panel would monitor whether the research findings are legally compliant, privacy rights of the population are thus not endangered.  <br>
Technology could facilitate the work of a policeman, who no longer watch 35 monitors would have to laboriously, but receives a message, <br>
"if something unusual happened."  <br>
Data protectionists criticize, however, that findings from INDECT the trend that more and more police data processing deals with innocent strengthened.  <br>
If one believes the testimony of PSI Transcom, INDECT desires of partners are thwarted again and data protection concerns: <br>

 I can assure you that was spoken in the project from the start, more privacy and is, as everything else. The authorities involved in commenting any planned technical development in this direction. 
Patrick coward, PSI Transcom

The Promotional Video for INDECT works but with a different symbolism, and demonstrates the desire to help police forces to comprehensive tecnicalsupported  "Situation Awareness".  <br> 
Shown is a sequence of random access to cameras in public spaces and a comparison with police databases. The video was an introduction of a lecture,  <br>
"of the House wanted to wake up something," appeased coward. In the Connection it would have a discussion with the speakers gave very critical. "  <br>
The video has been uploaded to YouTube by project partners, "because not all were present at the said Conference. <br>

To the critics of the student union of the University of Wuppertal to calm, the student was offered the part of the project coordinator Dziech to designate a member of the "Ethics Board". <br>
This would make the project the students questions about the current state of research.  <br>
Allegedly there was a commitment to accept travel expenses for this purpose. In advance of the student parliament has been criticized as strengthened by participation  <br>
in the dubious "Ethics Board" the legitimacy of the whole project is. <br>
