Need /b/lackup. all Red Army soldiers add ComradeEdward the instant you get an account. LET OUR MOTHERLAND CRUSH THEM INTO NOTHING!!!

Due to the twifag's new movie is out, we should begin to DDoS them to help the other anons that are already causing their community to BAWWWW. Right now only a few people are doing, but we need moar people. I suggest that every Sunday at 11 pm GMT (7 EST) we attack until some results are made. A one man DoS does nothing, so get your LOIC or Longcats started up.

= Twifag ruin: Round 2 =

After the massively successful raid on [http://anonym.to/http://twilighters.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=9160&start=10 twilighters.org] we are continuing our crusade against the jizzstain that are twifaggots on the internet. We will not stop until they are all scared shitless to start another fucking stupid fansite or post about their retarded obsessions with Jacob's dick.

What we know:

They have an [[IRC]] network at irc.ipocalypse.net
It's run by some faggot named Eric who is also apparently in charge of the server. 
It also hosts [http://anonym.to/http://ipocalypse.net ipocalypse.net] and [http://anonym.to/http://hpforums.org hpforums.org]

How you can help:

* [[Forum_Trolling|Troll]] them mercilessly on the forums.
* Dox them, and refer to this for further [[Ruin_Life_Tactics|tactics]]
* If you're a 1337 h4x0r on steroids join irc.partyvan.info #twirape
* code a Forum Flooder for phpBB
* phpBB 3.0.6 appears to be outdated (current is at least 3.0.7)
* Make them cry/puke/feel pain
* Use mail flooders on admins and mods

As always, current information can be found on IRC. Rest assured we have 1337 skiddies working around the clock to h4x them, but we can't do it without YOUR help.

What a great site.  Those TwiFucks are going down. <-- obvious spy is obvious

   1. Never reveal psyops names to anyone

   6. try to fit in.
   7. Pay attention, make friends.
   8. Write notes to yourself. Journalize, keep dates and important events. Use just a word document on your own comp.
