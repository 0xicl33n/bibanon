CleverMegle, or Clever Omegle is a new troll. It is the act of trolling Omegle with Cleverbot. The idea is simple, get on Omegle, and respond with cleverbot's reponses to the stranger. 

The most used tool is CleverOmegle, found at http://frtechhelp.vipersrt3g.com/
Since it was introduced by the FailShipIRC, it's wildly used troll software.
CleverOmegle should work on most platforms because it's cocked in java.
