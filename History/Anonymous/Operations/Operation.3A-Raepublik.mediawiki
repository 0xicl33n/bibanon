== Congress Election News ==

Okay fags we got 60% of the congress under our control. Vote for all our laws that would fuck up their Economy. DON'T FOR FOR ANY LAWS PROPOSED BY KITTEN AND HIS FAGS, THEY ARE COUNTERING OUR MOVES AGAIN!!!
<b><font size="5" color="#FF0006">MAKE SOCKS BEFORE ELECTION! IT ONLY TAKES 5-6 DAYS TO GET TO LVL 7 AND WE NEED AS MANY ANON VOTES AS POSSIBLE!</font></b><br>
Of extra importance is that you <strong>IGNORE</strong> ads telling anons/LFDR members who to vote for, as the first bunch are sure to be from Kittens. Only refer to the thread or IRC for instructions on whom to vote for. Anyone who goes against these orders will be executed publicly.

==Details==

[http://anonym.to/?http://erepublik.com Erepublik] is a site that advertises itself as "The New World". In early August 2009, Sancho Sete posted on 7chan's /b/ a suggestion to start a small group in eRepublik's Venezuela and try to take it over. What began as trickle of anons quickly grew to over 120 members joining Venezuela in the span of 2 days. The new citizen's fee (an amount of money given to new citizens by the government) bankrupted the country and caused an economic panic that was treated with high government taxes and a lower new citizen's fee.

The 7channer's quickly called their plan "SeVenezuela." Ultramannen, a Swedish high-level player, quickly became the beacon of experience for the SeVenezuelans and they built their companies and parties around the ideas of Ultramannen, Rodrigo, Sancho Sete, Barry McCockiner, and others. But an unexpected person entered the 7chan's irc.

Dubrovnik1919, an eCroat, lead a team of DIRTY BASTARDS that infiltrated several small countries and took over the government, donating all the money to their organization, and promptly leaving. They would use this money to fund their own coke parties and wars (at this time, the eUS and Canada was being taken over by Russia, Indonesia, Portugal, and Hungary. Croatia was nominally on the US's side.) Dubrovnik came forward and asked for assistance to take over Venezuela and squeeze it for everything it had. But the SeVenezuelans promptly told Dubrovnik to GTFO, resulting in him telling his fellows to '''REPORT FUCKING EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING.''' Several 7channers were banned, as was the organization that held their gold and businesses. But they made new accounts and rebuilt, eventually culminating in getting a 35% share in the Venezuelan Congress (the largest share) and a Presidency (which failed because the Presidential Import was a douchebag).

As of now, <s>the SeVenezuelans are maintaining their kung-fu grip on Congress and are planning to retake the Presidency with a not-so-douche guy</s> 888chan and 7chan control congress now, time to finish them. <s>Though Venezuela is nominally part of PEACE (the biggest and most dastardly of alliances in eRepublik)</s> PEACE is dead, there are plans to alter the political status- to either become totally neutral, to join EDEN (the other important alliance), or to make ALA (Alliance of Latin Americans) the prominent power in South America.

inb4you guys ask what does this have to do with 888.

We originally planned to rape the e-world using eNorth Korea, but some commiefags and Iranian sandniggers were up to no good, starting trouble in our neighborhood. So instead of sending us to Bel-Air, our mom told us to raise our powerlevels in SeVenezuela, where it was safe and there actually was stuff to buy with our jewgolds.

<s>So we struck an alliance with 7chan, they help us liberate/conquer North Korea and we help them take over Venezuela.</s><s>We're on our own, boys. In IRC it was asked the list of users and references be removed. There's a power struggle going on there over the idea of trolling. Wilko quit LV to start his own party. Also, cocks.</s>

Wilko eschewed *chans altogether and went for fair play. The workforce of 7chan is still willing to help us.

The natives are aware of us now. http://anonym.to/?http://www.erepublik.com/en/article/mecanismo-de-decisi-n-en-las-pr-ximas-elecciones--970762/1/20

==Tips==
*Friend ONLY those involved with planning or listed in the [http://insurgen.info/wiki/Operation_Raepublik#Trusted_Anons[Trusted]] section. This way up-to-date shouted information can be delivered without clutter from newfags and retards.
*If you find a friendly who owns a newspaper, upvote and subscribe to it.
*Get yourself to level 6 as quickly as possible, you get 5 jewgolds when reaching level 6.
*When you get your very first jewgolds at level 6, donate it to an anon company manager listed in the companies. You wont do shit it with, besides we have enough companies. You'll be helping the cause. Every gold matters.
*Buy 5-16 food (from an anon company like Alimentos la Granja if possible). Q1-only if you can abuse the hospital for wellness, a little higher if you can't. Don't spend all your monies in noms, though. You still need that money to buy weapons and stuff.
*Train and go to work EVERY FUCKING DAY, provided you are in an anon company or do not plan to only use your account for voting. DO NOT MISS A DAY FROM WORK IF YOU WORK IN AN ANON RUN COMPANY. It takes two fucking clicks.
*When you are level 5, check every day if there is a war. Be sure to live in northeastern SeVenezuela, it has a Q5 hospital. You'll get 10xp per day from fighting when healing in a Q5 hospital.
*GET IN THE FUCKING IRC AND ASK AN OP WAT DO BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING
*Don't pay attention to ads, we almost never run ads instructing voters unless necessary to counter trolls. Ask for info in the IRC

==SOCIALISM==

===eVenezuela===

*Start in North Eastern Venezuela [http://anonym.to/?http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dFk5XzJWeEl1NHk0OF9QSGlOZ2tNQlE6MA Spreadsheet for assistance]
*Vote for <s>Libertad</s> La Frente de Revolucion of Venezuela
*Find a job in an anon company or move to another country with anon jobs. DO NOT REQUEST CITIZENSHIP AFTER MOVING
*<s>Open companies with recognizable names to give /b/rothers a place to get monies. Variety is key.</s> Do not open companies in eVen, you'll only be competing with anons. If you insist on wasting gold ask where to put a company in the IRC.
*'''VENEZUELA IS DOING A LOT BETTER THEN NORTH KOREA''' Make your character in Venezuela to have a better impact. We shall spread to other nations once our base is secure.

*OPTIONAL: Start in Great Andes, Peru. Ask [http://www.erepublik.com/en/organization/2126178| Venture Industries Inc] to give you a job.

*<i>Alternatively, start in eVen, lvl up to 3-6 and then move to NK to work for slave wages in anon companies.</i>
*Get your army powerlevel up to fight in the resistance war.
*Liberate North Korea

====Notes====
The current president, Drago, is a traitor to eNK.<br>

<s>As of now, the last of eNK has been taken over by Iranian Sand-Niggers.  Fuck.</s> The Hamgyong region is back in eNK hands, but drago and his cocksuckers rule with an iron fist. Needs moar trolling.

===To Do===

* Anon startups most in need of some jewgolds:
*http://anonym.to/?http://www.erepublik.com/en/referrer/PedroBear69
*http://anonym.to/?http://www.erepublik.com/en/referrer/DentalPlan
*http://anonym.to/?http://www.erepublik.com/en/referrer/MuscleRoller
*http://anonym.to/?http://www.erepublik.com/en/referrer/teronism
*Be born in Venezuela, North Eastern province.
*Level up your job skill, make sure you work and train and eat every day.
*If there is a war going on, fight in it and regain your wellness at the hospital. Try to maintain a wellness of 100.
*Another thing to do is to figure out their methods on tracking multis so we can do it securely. However don't do the obvious stupid things. Change IP, Delete cookies. Don't log off of one account, and immediately into your other one. This will make it obvious after a while. Also don't associate the two accounts in the game, or on the forum.
*Join the political party <s>La Libertad de Venezuela</s> La Frente de Revolucion. Vote for MuscleRoller for Party President, whoever our candidate is for national president, and whoever you are assigned for Congressman. For the congressional elections, you may have to move to another province. You should be supplied with a moving ticket.
If you have used MuscleRoller's referral, ask Kim Technologies for a job and a ticket if you need. You will be given a salary above the natives.
*Donate all your extra gold to an anon owned org, found here: [http://insurgen.info/wiki/Operation_Raepublik#Organ/i/zations Organ/i/zations], for the good of North Korea!
*<s>Make a multi account guide?</s> http://anonym.to/?http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0ARQkk46XFFkbZDJ6djQ5Yl8wZmQ1NGR2ZDM&hl=en Delivered.
*SPREAD THE WORD!
[[File:KimWantsYOU.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Poster courtesy of Anon.]]

===Jew Gold, and eMoney===

Jew gold is the secondary currency all eRepublik citizens use, what it is worth is dependent on which country's currency it is to be exchanged with, with this in mind someone could make a tidy Profit playing the exchange something like the stock market. Unfortunately in the eWorld Jew Gold cannot be exchanged for delicious cake and hookers.  

*1g  - Is worth anywhere between 40 and 70 of your country's credits. 
*2g  - Can buy you your own news paper, which wouldn't be such a great deal but with /b/lackup you can get anonymous to rate it up and get you the media mogul award worth 5g.
*5g  - Doesn't buy you much, but everyone gets it at level 6.
*10g - Can buy you a medium supply of high level products and insure that you reach levels faster. 
*20g - Can buy you a business but be warned that cake is a lie, because you'll also need extra funds to pay your employees. 
*50g - You can start a war, or a revolution.

eMoney is by comparison nothing next to Jew gold but it is the stuff that companies give you for your work, it is what you can use to buy: food, weapons, air fair, and gifts(supposedly not hookers), companies can use it to buy: lumber, grain, oil, and diamonds(supposedly not hooker bait). Companies con only use the country's national currency to buy such resources.

===Trusted Anons===

For up to date list get in the fucking IRC, trusted have ops.

===Untrustables===

There have been a few anons who have attracted negative attention by being faggots. Don't trust them, don't listen to them. There is a possibility they could not be anons at all, trying to detract us.

*Kittens - PA'd NIGGERTITS <s>to start fucking over eVenezuela</s> for jewgold. Also thinks he's a supar awesome troll and that he can conquer the world by himself. <s>Is still working with 7chan to further their goals while throwing 888chan under the bus.</s> 7chan claims he's gone rogue yet again, and his failtrolling seems to be aimed at all *chans in eVen nao.
*aeiou1 - Attempted to blackmail Hermit, possibly others? Wanted going or else he would whiteknight.
Faggot here, It was a joke to see how stupid you newfags are. Here is his own response:"yeah there are a lot of newbies joining inand of course you can subscribe. I just though it was kind of stupid to ransom something likethat but I guess if it was a joke you got me

If they have newspapers, subscribe to them and vote them up when published.

===Starting your own Company===

If you somehow manage to scrape together the funds to make a company,(it means you aren't donating your damn jewgold, DO IT FGT) it's important to know what you're doing first. If there's not enough population to support new companies, then it will be difficult to find the required employees to keep your company afloat. Also, go here: http://anonym.to/?http://www.erepublik.com/en/country/Venezuela *USE ANONYM.TO FAGGOT* and scroll to the bottom. Look at all the areas, most of them have some sort of resource zone. The higher the resource zone, the more efficient raw product companies are. High zones produce almost twice as medium, and lows(not listed) produce next to nothing. This is only a concern, however, if you're making a land company. Manufacturing companies, which turn the raw resources into products, aren't affected by resource zones. Next, go to Marketplace -> Marketplace. Here you can see how much Venezuela and other countries are selling their various products. Thus, you can see how competitive each market it is and use it to judge which products are needed or not.

<b>
However, for now, PLEASE avoid making companies. Our funds are very stretched at the moment, and we can't afford anything else right now. With the new VEBs being printed, the welfare companies and public economy should be able to provide you with some jobs and allow for grind time while we get our funds back on our feet. Your jewgolds are better off going to help our current companies. This is the first step in being able to control the market.
</b>

==Sub-Operations==

===Operation:Spengbab===

The ultimate goal is to get a supermajority(26 seats) in Congress. If we do this, we can abolish the Venezuelan government and appoint MuscleRoller, Kim's Socialism Spirit given e-flesh, Supreme Dictator. From there, we can take actions on North Korea.

However, the act of doing this is not as simple as it sounds. In order to do so, we're going to need a few more votes than we have. How are we going to do this? Well, being as 888chan's side is an /i/ operation, we're going to be insurgents. I've hand-selected some of your best insurgents for the job. At least, as far as I know, I obviously haven't lurked enough to know who truly is. That can be corrected with time.

Regardless, they're going to be infiltrating enemy parties to steal their votes.

How can YOU help?

It's quite simple. There are two options. You can stay in <s>La Libertad de Venezuela</s> La Frente de Revolucion, or join an enemy party. But the things you must do in each party will be vastly different.

If you choose <s>La Libertad de Venezuela</s> La Frente de Revolucion, then you must remain completely silent in the media. This is the option for those who don't wish to invest much time in Erepublik. Don't attract any attention; <s>7chan is going to be doing all the trolling on our side</s>. We're going to pretend to become outraged at the Venezuelan's reactions to draw criticism.

However, for those who are willing to invest a little more time... join an enemy party. Any of them will do, really. Any but LF. From here, you will take the Venezuelan's side in their arguments against us. You must be reasonable, but judgmental and passionate in your accusations against our actions and political trolling. We'll be giving you plenty of ammunition to throw at us, don't worry. Also before you attempt to do this and give us away, make sure you read our tutorial on [[PsyOps]]. It will make it harder for the rest of us if you just get on and start screaming "go MuscleRoller" You must find a way to use the same arguments they are using for us. They have a plan just like we do. You need to shape their plan to meet ours. Make them think it's what they want.

This will draw their eyes away from internal party politics, and make them more confident of their falsely improved numbers. They won't see our deep-cover insurgents coming. Near the next elections, our insurgents will run for congress in their parties, depending on how much public support they have. If they have enough support, they will soak up the enemy's votes like a spengbab. Simple, but effective.

I don't need to say that English is NOT ACCEPTABLE if you choose the latter option, do I? Use an online translator. If Google Translate is too gay for you, message TheNaCL or ChavezBear for help.

I made a mistake. It seems that the constitutions actually don't mean anything. So therefore we cannot permanently cement control over the country.

However, the plan will still move forward, as a supermajority will still allow us to declare war on faggots if we so desire. There's no doubt in my mind that now we'll be able to get a standard majority every election as well.

===Operation: Telecom===

It has came to anonymous's attention that there is a job problem in eVenezuela, while anonymous members acknowledge that the mother land is important it would be recommended that if any /b/rothers out of the country have companies with access to cheep resources that they consider not only donating but also give wages to the jobless proletariat's of eVenezuela. In regards to the rumor that scavanna was not even a anon at all, Scavanna (me) opted to start Operation Telecom, an outsourcing program. Moldavia was chosen because there are plenty of untapped resources in grain there and it was convenient because Scavanna (me) already was in that area and would not need a moving ticket. 

Some countries with anonymous run business include but are not limited to:

Peru - Kim's Iron Mines and Brock's Bountiful Boards.
*Peru has high resources on both.
*In the long run the government will be weakened by dodged taxes and internal selling.
*Near-free materials for SeVenezuela will help the manufacturing and construction industry, giving it more profit.
*Critically needs dedicated workers. PM Kim Technologies if interested.
USA - Kim's Comfortable Blocs
*Cheap workers.

South Africa - Salamancan Pear Jewelery and Kimban Salaryman Gifts
* Niggaland has high diamond resources.
* Same as Kim's companies, will severely hurt nigga economy (lol wut) by internal selling.
* Limpopo, South Africa, has constant wars and a q5 hospital. Perfect for abusing.

===Operation: AIDSwarm===

(information redacted, it'll be added back as things calm down)

===Organic AIDS Bomb===

Operation AIDSwarm taken to an extreme scale, final stage.

Should we fail in our attempts to conquer the world, we'll deploy the Organic AIDS Bomb.

(information redacted, it'll be added back as things calm down)

Only use in case of emergency. Mix with a round of SoDDomy for better results.

===Operation BRB Soup===
Organic AIDS but we legally and logically buy food from our companies. That way anons get all the Jewgold legally and the puppets look like those one shot players that get bored and GTFO. We need well known anons to license Q1&Q2 food in the countries with the highest exchange value.

Current Winrar: Japan! 30 JPY = 1 JEWGOLD

GO GO GO

===Operation Worst Korea===
After We Liberate Best Korea from those Muslim sandniggers many of us will be "what now?" Well for those who want to stick around and cause more Lulz on our next step of world domination the next plan is to take back Worst Korea (aka South Korea fags) From the SouthKorean/Japanese control.
Goals after taking back Best Korea: 

1. Secure borders with defensive systems and move out as many people from Venezuela into North Korea while maintaining a group in Venezuela to maintain control and act as a training base for the people just joined. 

2.  Make a Alliance with China (they will be our allies in the long run).

3. Make contingency plan to invade South Korea while blocking other countries from getting involved through blocking Alliances.

4. Cause mass butthurt and delicious South Korean tears

5.?????

6.PROFIT!
