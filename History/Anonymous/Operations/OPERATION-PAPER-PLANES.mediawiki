=Introduction=
On 11/9/2010 we will throw paper planes made of the quran and we will display pictures of Mohammad in New York city near the proposed location of the ground zero mosque. This is not for any moral reason and is perpetrated solely for the lulz. This operation will also entail sending ham pizzas to the location of the Muslim organization behind it, sending faxes, and anything that can be considered ruin life tactics.
