==Details==

Gentlemen,

Let us continue the fine work we were doing on ReligiousFreedomWatch.org. For those of you who don't know what's going on:

A Scientology front group called Religious Freedom Watch is publishing false information about Anonymous.

The site has lumped /b/tards searching for lulz and moralfags protesting the Co$ together in an attempt to discredit both groups. This has only managed to piss-off both sides; /b/tards and moralfags have joined forces to bring down this anti-lulz website.

Earlier in the day, /b/ was able to bring down the site for a number of hours and even some word that they had hacked the account and was either in the process of deleting all the content or replacing it all with keyboard cat.
^^^ Moar info on this please, I haven't been following /b/ these days. 

Let's finish the fight.

EDIT: They know about the wiki, please dont post any more information here.

==Raid==
Nobody posted here about the first wave, but why not a second one?
Counter at 0:30 UTC tomorrow. Yes, anons. Tonight we finish this fight. LEAVE THE LAZOR RUNNING FOR AN HOUR.
[http://anonym.to?http://timeanddate.com/counters/customcounter.html?month=7&day=13&year=2009&hour=0&min=30&sec=00&p0=0 Counter.]<br>
Remember to use a [[Proxy]] because they are offering rewards for the IPs of anons.

===Tools===

I also recommend for the starting anon to get [[Low Orbit Ion Cannon|LOIC]] and/or [[Dangerous Kitten]]; go to an internet cafe, a friend's house, or use a vpn, but '''don't fucking flood the Tor network'''.

Note: Stick with LOIC.  Read about EFC [http://anonym.to/http://pastebin.com/m3c8ba14a here.]

==To Do==

*Fire lazorz.
*Spam emails.
*Spam [http://anonym.to/http://www.religiousfreedomwatch.org/media-newsroom/behind-the-facade-of-the-%E2%80%9Canonymous%E2%80%9D-hate-group/#foot-1 this page] with comments by Anonymous.
*BW Raep with [http://anonym.to/http://www.religiousfreedomwatch.org/medianews/When%20crime%20has%20no%20face.pdf this PDF.]

==Email==
Put this email through every spam technique you know: <br>
<b>reward5000@earthlink.net</b><br>
[[MailRape]], [[Spam List]], [[Sparky's Mailbomber]], [[Nraep]].

They are offering a reward for anonymous IPs.<br />
If they truly are offering rewards for anonymous ips, how in the hell would they go about verifying them?  Why can't we make a list of over 9000 "anon" ips and sell it to them? Lets just grap IP's from wikipedia. What about selling them Scilon IPs? <-- DO IT

Probably something to "scare" anons and encourage white knights to help them. Also, a lot of watchdog groups have these "report racist websites" or "report a chauvinist/homophobe" shit so they're probably copying them to seem more legit. - IsaacClarke
