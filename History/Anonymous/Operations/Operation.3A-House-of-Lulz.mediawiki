<h2><big><strong>NOTICE 2!</strong></big></h2>
THEY FOUND OUT ABOUT 888CHAN AND NOW THEY KNOW ABOUT THE WIKI, WATCH OUT!

==Phone==
We have their confirmed phone number and it will be released on the day on the raid in order to stop newfags and whiteknights from alerting then or messing up the raid. 

Phone Number: +441704830597

<h2>Details</h2>
The Walmsley family are a bunch of Britfags living somewhere in Liverpool. They decided it would be a good idea to place cameras all throughout their house and broadcast the feeds onto the internet. They have also set up a chat system that displays on a monitor in the kitchen. The daughter seems to be fairly compliant with requests made of her. Some [[Social Engineering]] may reveal dox.

<h2>Raid</h2>
This raid should operate mainly through trolling. The parents seem to think that the goings-on of their chat room is serious business, and the father has been known to go on a tantrum if sufficiently provoked. Once dox are procured, commence life ruination. Some of the kids seem to be really attached to their Grandfather that recently passed away, we can use this to our advantage because everyone knows that there is nothing funner than getting JB to cry their eyes out.

<h3>Schedule & Counter</h3>
All the time until 27th of June, when they have a karaoke night. We will destroy them. Until 27th just troll them a little, perhaps [[Ruin life tactics|moar pizza]] or just prank calls. Some people should try to [[PsyOps]] their way to mod status in their chat room, then go apeshit on 27th. <br>
 For all the fags that fail at time zones here;
 Eastern time   Thursday, June 18, 2009 at 3:00:00 PM

<h3>Multiple cam viewer</h3>
It's dangerous to go alone.<br>
Take this: [http://anonym.to/http://houseoflulz.host-ed.net/lulz.html]<br>
note: try starting all the videos at the same time for optimal sync.

<h2>Ambassador</h2>
The Duties of the Ambassador (Awesomekip) include all things relating to negotiations between anon and the Walmsley family whether it be peace treaty, alliance, cease fire, moar jailbait, or trade agreement. Awesomekip is Anon's voice Walmsley lands. At the request of the Anon he may act as the represenative of the Anon in other lands and in the absence of the longcat and tacgnol acts as the Royal stead within and outside the Walmsley affair. The office of Awsomekip answers only to Anon. They share the same power.

<h2>Dox</h2>
[[File:Location Proof.png|right|thumb|Location based on google maps, the article, and their back yard web cam]]
We know that they live on Ward Ave, just off of Kirklake Rd, and we know their names, but little else is known about them. 
[http://anonym.to/http://www.youtube.com/user/barebonestv This] is their Youtube channel, but it does not contain any immediate hints to any dox.
 

<h3>House Address</h3>
The address of their house is really important to making sure that we get the most lulz from this raid. The direct address is needed in order coordinate 

deliveries and such things.
<s>Anon has tracked the house down to Liverpool --> Formby --> Kirklake Rd.</s> 

Their house address:   
  7 Ward Avenue
  Formby
  Liverpool
  Merseyside
  L37 2JD
  United Kingdom

The names in the article all match up with those on their web page. The article only has 2 pieces of good info, their house is white and that it's on Kirklake road.  

<h3>Site Information</h3>

<h2>What we need</h2>
A list of local delivery businesses is needed in order to coordinate deliveries to the house. We also need anon that is willing to make phone calls setting up the deliveries.  

<strike>There are not many places in fornby a new plan may be needed</strike> We will work with what we can. wow look at all those Ws mmmmm

What about http://anonym.to/http://liverpool.gumtree.com/ ? there are plenty of services on there for any anons to ring and order to their house for the day. 

Supposedly Melissa's secret question for emai is "Favorite pets name", someone needs to try all the pet names.

<h3>More Stuff</h3>
Working progress

How about the classic tactic of a fake garage sale/free shit? Somebody could post a link on http://anonym.to/http://liverpool.gumtree.com/ saying that they're selling their stuff/giving it away. This could create an endless stream of people coming to the house while we watch the lulz commence.

I have created an advert over at gumtree.com for a Charity Garage Sale [http://anonym.to/http://liverpool.gumtree.com/liverpool/68/40409468.html LINK].<--- Outdated, make a new one with date 27 June 2009 and make it earlier so people have a chance to see it.

<h2>Victories</h2>
* [http://anonym.to/http://888chan.org/i/src/1244838980817.png Shoe on Head]
* Got dad to RAGEEEEEEEEE, threatened to call the Party Van.
* Two pizza deliveries
* Over 9000 phone calls, this caused much RAAAAAAAAGE from dad.
* Mom was seen crying before she went to bed.
* A very ballsy anon actually got the Fire Dept to the house. This caused MUCH RAAAGE and lulz.
* They disabled their webchat because of trolls.
<h3>Quotes</h3>
"The net is closing in" -dad <br>
"We haven't ordered any pizza" -mum <br>
"mummy, mummy, MUMMY!" -Melissa <br>
"Somebody asked for Rick Astley" (on the phone) -mum <br>
"Tracing your number (pronounced "noombah")" -dad <br>
"Are ye such a coward? Are ye shittin yourself now?" -dad <br>
" *RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGE* " -dad <br>
" The internet, they think they're so clever, but what they dont understand is that the internet was made by man"- dad <br>
" I hope you are proud of yourself you fucking idiots!" -dad, after dealing with the fire dept <br>
"The phone rings every 5 minutes." -mum <br>
"They all just keep playin' Rick Astley" -dad <br>
"One hacker, just one hacker!" -dad. Then he raged out a mishmash of words about how he'd kill us if he found us. Chat agreed.  <br>

<h3>Failures</h3>
* Hall cam was slow as FUCK (like 1 frame per MINUTE) so no screencaps of pizza deliveries.
* Some pizza places didn't deliver.
* Some faggot mentioned 888chan in the chat.
