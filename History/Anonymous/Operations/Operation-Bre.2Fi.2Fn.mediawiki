 [[File:Brein.png|thumb|209px|right|The plan, as outlined by /i/nsurgents.]]
'''Stichting BREIN''' (Lit. BRAIN Foundation...wtf?) is a Dutch company somewhat akin to the [[RIAA and MPAA|RIAA]] that apparently thinks it can censor the Internets. 

In July, 2009 it successfully managed to [http://www.informationweek.com/news/government/policy/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=218900200 persuade a judge to block ISPs] in the Netherlands from accessing Pirate Bay. The organizers of the Pirate Bay were given 10 days to block traffic to and from the Netherlands, or face stiff fines.

/[[b]]/, of course, after the recent [[AT&T|AT&T debacle]], was up in arms about this (and if you think net neutrality is moralfaggotry, shut the fuck up), and immediately [[DDoS]]ed [http://www.brein.info BREIN's website (?)] into sweet cyberspace oblivion.

BREIN has a history with this sort of [[faggotry|censorship]]. Popular BitTorrent tracker site OiNK was shut down within five days of being reported to the company. The CEO of BREIN, Tim Kuik, is currently under attack by [[Anonymous]]. [[Dox]] have not yet been confirmed as legitimate, but confirmation should be forthcoming.

This section needs moar, help by [http://insurgen.info/w/index.php?title=Operation_Bre/i/n&action=edit editing] it.

==Irony==
Brein's email(?) server uses entirely open source software. It's all a bit out-of-date though.
