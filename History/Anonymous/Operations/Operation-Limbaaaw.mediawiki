Gentlemen. You all remember the Hal Turner raids, and the lulz they brought; you remember the Tom Green raids, and how they made us feel. What I am proposing dwarfs both of them. '''Three Words: Rush Fucking Limbaugh.''' This ain't a PA request. Though i do lean left (I'll admit that), I am more disgusted at Rush Limbaugh's fat, sweaty, pain-killer addicted body.

# We spread rumors, whisper campaigns. We contact several bloggers and newspapers and inform them that he's a furry. Might not work, but the effort is worth it (it might actually be true, anyhow).
# Begin Hal Turneresque prank call tactics. Raid him for great justice. He might have screeners, so make up some bullshit story about how Obama is the antichrist or some shit.
# Life ruination tactics (pizza, others).
# Limbaugh an heros, we all live happily ever after.
# ????
# PROFIT

You can also SODD his site if you wish, but isn't the main part of this raid.
