==Intro==

The target is a Jew with at least 3 lawyers in his family who has probably taken Computer Science 3. Eh is going to sue the internet and doesn't afraid of anything. Shitting on his face would be a crime. He offers services such as:

Virus OR Spyware Removal - $199.00 Includes removal of either viruses or spyware from your computer. If your computer is infected with both, there will be an additional charge of $49.00. Operating System Updates are included at no extra change. On-going Virus/Spyware protection software NOT INCLUDED. 

Wireless Network Configuration - $149.00 Includes setting up your wireless router/access point, configuring wireless security, and enabling file and print sharing on up to 2 computers. Additional computers are $49.00 each. Hardware/Software NOT INCLUDED. 

Software Installation - $99.00 Includes installing software to one computer, testing, and applying updates if necessary. Additional computers are $49.00/each. Hardware/Software NOT INCLUDED.

He also sells overpriced components on ebay. Being a crybaby jewfuck, he immediately gets butthurt should you criticize his shitty rip-off service. He will threaten to sue you if you leave negative feedback or cuss at him.

Being like many raving Republicans, Adam L. Goldstein is obsessed with his "American Rights".  He believes that one can be arrested for using foul language, such as "asshat".

 Evening gents'
 We at SomethingAwful require your assistance. While goondom and bee-ocity can accomplish much we have stumbled upon
 something so utterly delicious we couldn't keep it away from you raving lunatics.
 Here is the beginning,

 The meat of the matter is that Adam L. Goldstein LLC who runs a crap company called ATECH computer services decided
 to be a king-sized douche. After poking and prodding we found that he is a raving lunatic!
 So, whilst we are under the reigns of our admins and thusly cannot do much beyond making fun of him on our forums.. 
 we give you the information to do whatever with.

At approximately 3:45 GMT on 20 July 2009 he apparently revealed his IP to be 68.36.51.167, leading /b/ to believe that he either used a proxy (unlikely) or failed CS3 and is unqualified to offer his Software Installation Services (pic, right)[[Image:goldip.png|thumb|right|Apparently CS3 wasn't his strong suit]]

Though he is a hosting provider, it seems he is only a reseller and therefore probably has a very small bandwidth limit, as evidenced by the fact that his entire hosting provider site is only 84kb. Point your bwraep tools at http://cleanoutsvcs.com/index.htm

==Phone Raid==
(PROTIP: http://anonym.to/?http://wakerupper.com/)
===Abstract===
Listen up men, this is strictly a volunteer mission.  Many of you will likely not return, and fewer still will return unscathed.  We are going to troll our target, hereby designated Jewgold, by phone.  Expect much lulz, rage, and 'who was phone', so stay frosty. <br>
Note that this attack will require a certain degree of coordination, so make sure you familiarize yourself with the plan before charging your lazors.  Also, be sure to keep this shit away from 4chan until the later stages of the raid (where they can only do so much damage).  

===Phase I:  Recon===
This phase begins immediately and will continue throughout the raid.  In other words, start gathering intel nao.  We need moar of the following:
* Phone numbers—we can proceed without, but moar is better.
* Late-night delivery services of any kind—this will be useful for Phase II
* Anons who can troll IRL—Useful for all phases, including lulz documentation

===Phase II:  Sleep Deprivation===
This phase begins Friday July 24 (Yes, it's soon.  We're trying to avoid white knights) at 3:00 AM EST.  Our objective is to send the target to work completely exhausted.  In such a state, anything we do will elicit even more rage.  We want to keep him from going to sleep, so trolling has to be done carefully.  He needs to get exactly ONE phone call per hour starting at 3:00 AM.  Please fill in the following time slots with "filled" in order to volunteer.  You may fill more than one slot, but please make sure you can actually follow through and DO NOT call him more than once per hour.  If he turns his phone off too early, Phase I is dead.
* 3:00 AM: Goddammit. Fine. I'm going to bed afterwards.
* 4:00 AM: Call reminding That its going to be beautiful day. 
* 5:00 AM:
* 6:00 AM:
* 7:00 AM:
Also, stay the FUCK away from his work phones.  We're hitting those the next day.
In order to maximize our efforts, and as insurance in case he turns his phone off, do the following:
* Ring his doorbell IRL (4chan that shit, but don't give them the full dox.  Address only)
* Order late-night delivery
* Anything else you can think of (Anything from Phase I goes here)


Also begin black faxing.  The idea is to have his fax machine be both out of ink and out of paper when he gets to work, so hit it hard.  Extra internets for black faxing FUCK in white letters against a black background.

===Phase III:  Epic Lulz Strike Package===
By now our target should be tired, angry, and on the brink of throwing a temper tantrum.  He may very well flip when he gets to work and notices his fax machine is dead.  The following should be performed throughout the day of Friday July 24 (there is no countdown or specified time because we want a constant flow throughout the day):
* Call his work phone and KEEP HIM ON THE LINE FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE before trolling him.
* Call his cell phone and do whatever the fuck you want
* Order food to his office
* Send Missionaries, etc... (Ruination)
* Send over9000 emails
* DOCUMENT THE FUCKING LULZ
<br>
Feel free to involve 4chan in the emailing, phoning, and IRL trolling.
===Phase IV:  Retreat and Evaluate===
Post fukken saves and discuss what do next.
* You faggots better record some of his rage... this guy is great on the phone.
