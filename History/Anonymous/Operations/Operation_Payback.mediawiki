The cyber-attackers who took Mastercard.com down earlier today just announced plans to take Visa.com down. They say their attack will commence in one hour.
This is, of course, revenge for both credit card companies shutting off donations to Wikileaks.
These are all part of Operation Payback, a coordinated attack on anti-piracy groups and others that started three months ago

= What led up to this =
With [[Wikileaks]] release of the U.S. Diplomatic Cables, pressure from governmental agencies was used to help remove any finacial support for [[Wikileaks]]. '''Mastercard Europe''' and '''Visa International'''  withdrew support and payment processes for accounts owned by [[Wikileaks]] editor-in-chief [[Julian Assange]].
