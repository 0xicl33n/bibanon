== Intro ==

Lockerz.com is a lame-ass site which has hired professional trolls to infiltrate and spam /b/.  Obviously, this means war. The preferred target in this raid should be Fanscape, since they were responsible for the spam and are the most vulnerable target according to our tests. Fanscape has also promoted faggotry such as Naruto, AT&T, Paramount, and others. It is high time that they learn the terrible price of spamming a *chan.

A list of email addresses was found through a security hole (now patched) on their site: http://pastebin.me/5b70292a3acb1837a6792c773a4c89d7

Life ruination tactics should be employed against Christian Valencia, Lockerz' CEO, and any Fanscape employees that end up being doxed.

{{quote|What is Lockerz?

Lockerz launches Fall 09. Get in early and start earning PTZ (pointz)!

Lockerz is the place to go to buy the coolest stuff at the lowest prices, watch exclusive video, discover new music, play the hottest games, hang out with your friends - and get rewarded for just about EVERYTHING you do on the site.

Our mission is to be your daily habit, not a site for your parents or grandparents looking for their long-lost friends from Kindergarten.

One other thing you'll love about Lockerz are PTZ (or "Pointz"). PTZ are Lockerz' proprietary loyalty "currency" that you earn whenever you buy, watch, play, share, invite friends, or even just show up on Lockerz. Redeem PTZ at the PTZ Place for incredible prizes, great products and dream experiences.

Too Good to Be True? Why are we doing this? To thank you for joining early. To build a Lockerz community of cool, stylish, cutting-edge people who love to buy great brands. To give you a taste of how PTZ will work when we go live this fall. And to test out different prizes and PTZ levels. Thatâ€™s key. This version of PTZ Place is a test. PTZ levels will change when the full Lockerz site launches.}}

[[Image:Fanscape Logo.gif|thumb|left|The cancer killing the internet]] This company FanScape was hired by Lockerz to go drum up fake hype and word of mouth publicity by spamming every fucking message board on the entire goddamn internet with invite offers, including /b/.

FanScape spies, after lurking all summer and studying ED carefully, hopped onto /b/ last weekend and suddenly every other thread was offering Lockerz invites.  In contrast to the usual spam on /b/, these threads are posted and maintained by actual people, trying their hardest to sound like they fit in.  Their special brand of well-studied newfaggotry, though, is easily spotted by anyone who talks to them for more than two minutes.

The outing of FanScape as the source of the spam has not completely scared them off of /b/, but <s>the following copypasta, along with a bit of sagebombing, has proven very effective at killing Lockerz threads. (Post it with the pic of Valencia above)</s> posting the following copypasta, followed by directly calling out the OP as a FagScape spammer has proven effective at killing threads.

Stale copypasta is stale.  Newer stuff below.

<s>DOES THIS FAGGOT LOOK FAMILIAR??

He is not the faggot known as Cameron Field, who is a Blue Ribbon ass fucker who whines and complains his 20 year old cum-sucker self doesn't get to do 200 GSN accounts and acts like a 4-year old girl who doesn't get his way.  He looks like a muppet.  [http://www.myspace.com/cfield07] proves it.  And here is a picture of his boyfriend and him  [http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewImage&friendID=10435602&albumID=267772&imageID=3270502].  </s> (WTF are you talking 'bout, nigger??)<s>
 
His name is Christian Valencia, goes to Seattle University, and works for a company called FanScape, an advertising company that manufactures internet hype. (Proof below)<br />

http://www.facebook.com/christiancloud<br />
http://twitter.com/christianuval<br />

This company FanScape is behind the L*****z spam<br />

FanScape infiltrates popular internet websites like 4chan, and tries to generate word of mouth hype for whatever shit they're promoting, in this case, L*****z.com. The vast majority of the invite threads are started by FanScape employees pretending to be /b/tards.<br />

Why not let them know how much you enjoy their spam?<br />
