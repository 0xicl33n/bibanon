::''Under Construction''

'''Operation: Darknet''' (aka '''Operation DarkNet''', '''OpDarkNet''', or '''ODN''') is an operation in development as early as April 2010.

The operation was re-assessed in early October 2011 to target [[Lolita City]], news of which surfaced in tabloids around the internet in late October.

=ACTA=
Your freedom, and the freedom of most of the world depends on this. Soon, the world will come to face something that the governments of the world are planning in secret, which will change the internet, its function, and its culture, completely. Here I ask you if you know about ACTA. If you don't, this treaty threatens to the end the internet as we know it. I won't bore you with details, but I'll share what, to me, is the most striking implication; if ACTA were to become law, ISP's will be forced to keep track of '''EVERYTHING''' that you do online. If they suspect (that says "suspect" not prove) you are partaking in what they deem “illegal” activities, you will be cut off from the internet for an indefinite period.

These “illegal” activities include, but are not limited too, plagiarizing information from sites on the internet, even simple copy-pasta like those quizzes, and surveys you like to fill out and show your friends, downloading even one song, one copyrighted song in a youtube video, or even using an image in a video you have downloaded. If even in the least, someone accuses you of this offense... '''YOUR INTERNET WILL BE CUT FROM YOU INDEFINATLY!!!'''...

==Leaks==
The European Commission analysis of ACTA's Internet chapter has leaked, indicating that the U.S. is seeking to push laws that extend beyond the WIPO Internet treaties and beyond current European Union law (the EC posted the existence of the document last week but refused to make it publicly available). The document contains detailed comments on the U.S. proposal, confirming the U.S. desire to promote a three-strikes and you're out policy, a Global DMCA, harmonized contributory copyright infringement rules, and the establishment of an international notice-and-takedown policy.

==ACTA Overview==
===Chapter 1 - General Obligations===
These focus on "effective enforcement procedures" with expeditious remedies that deter further infringement. The wording is similar to TRIPs Article 41, however, the EU notes that unlike the international treaty provisions, there is no statement that procedures shall be fair, equitable, and/or proportionate. In other words, it seeks to remove some of the balance in the earlier treaties. 

===Chapter 2 - Third party liability===
The third party liability provisions focus on copyright, though the EU notes that it could (should) be extended to trademark and perhaps other IP infringement. The goal of this section is to create an international minimum harmonization regarding the issue of what is called in some Member States "contributory copyright infringement". The U.S. proposal would include "inducement" into the standard, something established in the U.S. Grokster case, but not found in many other countries. This would result in a huge change in domestic law in many countries (including Canada) as the EU notes it goes beyond current EU law.

===Chapter 3 - Limitations on 3rd Party Liability===
This section spells out how an ISP may qualify for a safe harbor from the liability established in the earlier section. These include an exemption for technical processes such as caching. As reported earlier, ACTA would establish a required notice-and-takedown system, which goes beyond Canadian law (and beyond current EU law). Moreover, ACTA clearly envisions opening the door to a three-strikes and you're out model, as the EU document
States:
 
EU understands that footnote 6 provides for an example of a reasonable policy to address the unauthorized storage or transmission of protected materials. However, the issue of termination of subscriptions and accounts has been subject to much debate in several Member States. Furthermore, the issue of whether a subscription or an account may be terminated without prior court decision is still subject to negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council of Telecoms Ministers regarding the Telecoms Package.

===Chapter 4 - Anti-circumvention Provisions===
ACTA would require civil and criminal penalties associated with anti-circumvention provisions (legal protection for digital locks).  The EU notes that this goes beyond the requirements of the WIPO Internet treaties and beyond current EU law which "leaves a reasonable margin of discretion to Member States."  The EU also notes that there is no link between the anti-circumvention provisions and copyright exceptions.  The U.S. proposal also requires the anti-circumvention provisions to apply to TPMs that merely protect access to a work (rather than reproduction or making available). This would again go beyond current EU law to include protection against circumventing technologies like region coding on DVDs.  From a Canadian perspective, none of this is currently domestic law. As previously speculated, the clear intent is to establish a Global DMCA.

===Chapter 5 - Civil and Criminal Enforcement of Anti-Circumvention===
This section requires both civil and criminal provisions for the anti-circumvention rules, something not found in the WIPO Internet treaties. The anti-circumvention provisions are also designed to stop countries from establishing interoperability requirements (i.e. the ability for consumers to play purchased music on different devices). The EU notes that this not consistent with its law, which states "Compatibility and interoperability of the different systems should be encouraged." Of course, might reasonable ask why such a provision is even in ACTA.

===Chapter 6 - Rights Management Information protection===
This section includes similar criminal and civil requirements for rights management information. Quite literally commi bullshit.

===Chapter 7 - Limitations to Rights Management Information protection===
In summary, the EU analysis confirms the earlier leak (though the Internet chapter has seven sections, rather than five). The fears about the U.S. intent with respect to ACTA are confirmed - extending the WIPO Internet treaties, creating a Global DMCA, promoting a three-strikes and you're out model, even stopping efforts to create interoperability mandates. ACTA would render current Canadian copyright law virtually unrecognizable as the required changes go far beyond our current rules (and even those contemplated in prior reform bills). This begs the question of whether the Department of Foreign Affairs negotiation mandate letter really goes this far given the domestic changes that would be required. This latest leak also reinforces the need for all governments to come clean - releasing both the ACTA text and government analysis of the treaty should be a condition of any further participation in the talks.

=Plan of Attack=
This is very complex, unfortunately the targets are the citizens of the internet, ALL internet service providers, ALL major databases (save anything useful like google). The raid itself has a VERY high probability of failing, but we have procedures for this. In order for this to work... EVEN IN THE LEAST... we need every white, grey, black, red, blue, green, and plaid hat you know in on this, EVERY SINGLE LAST INDIVIDUAL SCRUPULOUS ONE OF THEM. This is only a last resort plan, and only if ACTA is a GO. I repeat, THIS IS A LAST RESORT.

==Phase 1 - 1 month before D-Day==
Lurk, every uberhacker ever, lurk, login on every major hub for 4 hours, raise the APPARENT userbases of these sites significantly... almost 10 fold. After the 4 hours mark starts leaving in a trickle, the world will notice you are no longer there, and they will follow you. Because humans in a group are massively hurr durp. They will have no idea whats going on, and figure that there is something making everyone else leave that they are left out on, they don't want to be in the dark... so they leave also. This trick will get EVERY ADMIN wondering what the fuck is going on. Save the smart ones.

==Phase 2 - 1 month to 1 week before D-Day==
After this mass demigration, and administrative log, this is a perfect opportunity to hit the places that have this administrative boom, lurk again. They will all seem a little weirded out, but they will return to their days as normal. This is tell us many things; if a keylogger is installed on the server, passwords; the number of active intelligent admins; the power of the servers and the ability for them to handle a full load. This will be done to each major hub over a 3 week period.

==Phase 3 - 1week to 2 days before D-Day==
Create mass hysteria, tell everyone about ACTA... EVERYONE. Don't leave any node unchecked, hit youtube and upload the same... exact... video... over... and over... and over. Make it the only thing anyone sees anyware. Mail FOX news, the white house, CNN, frequently visited pornsites. Basically ask, to protest ACTA legislation, download... download... download. Any and everything copyrighted, the layout of a shoeprint to the newest movie release. There is no way the government can control 500 million constant downloads on the internet for a solid 5 days, ISP's will be flooded, and have to sift through everything. On top of this, go to no theaters, buy no copyrighted content... nothing.

==Phase 4 - 2 days to 24 hours before D-Day==
By this time the government will have revoked ACTA legislation completely. However on the off chance this does not happen, this is our plan. While the "week long protest" is underway, and download of mass amounts are clogging internet bandwidth, everything is more vulnerable, the amount of information being dealt with is astronomical. The way to properly do this, is to bandwidth RAEP the entire internet. Make the internet itself, blow its load. This day is dedicated to bandwidth RAEP for just the sake of filling it. Clogging up the lines so badly, that the drano can't clear it before it's too late. We aren't just talking, "everyone torrent a 4 gig move of..." no we are talking everyone with the capabilities, memory, and processing speed torrent a terabyte of bs information, on multiple drives, from any number of seeds and sources. 1 Torrent to rule them all.

==Phase 5 - 24 hours to 8 hours before D-Day==
Start overloading servers, injecting major sites, admin protocols, delete server node configurations, get myspace and purge everything. You get it... delete... delete... delete... Use your most powerful polymorphic, packed with the most fuckton warhead possible, and just destroy the entire internet. Take it to the ground, and beat the living fuck out of it. Even non-hackers can do their share by taking everything sacred, and shiting all over it. Convince everyone to go to their favorite sites, and simply fill an account deletion request. Get every admin on earth to fork up the keys and say "fuck this shit".

==Phase 6 - 8 hours to 0 hour of D-Day==
While you are fucking everything up, use all the freed up bandwidth to take over all the server, and posts shit everywhere... fill all the servers back up with things they don't need... or just make the damage in repairable. Just get to the point where the main nodes of the internet pipeline fail, and every page 404's.

==Phase 7 - Post D-Day==
#Move to the Darknet, distribute manually the instructions to connect.
#???
#Profit... from others misfortune...

==Timeline==
*8:30 CST while browsing the [[Hidden Wiki]] we noticed a section called [[Hard Candy]] which was dedicated to links to child pornography. We then removed all links on the website, within 5 minutes the links were edited back in by an admin. For this reason, we will continue to make the Hidden Wiki unavailable.
*8:45 CST we noticed 95% of the child pornography listed on the Hidden Wiki shared a digital fingerprint with the shared hosting server at [[Freedom Hosting]].
*9:00pm CST on October 14, 2011 We identified Freedom Hosting as the host of the largest collection of child pornography on the internet. We then issued a warning to remove the illegal content from their server, which they refused to do.
*11:30pm CST on October 14, 2011 We infiltrated the shared hosting server of Freedom Hosting and shutdown services to all clients due to their lack of action to remove child pornography from their server.
*5:00pm CST on October 15, 2011 Freedom Hosting installed their backups and restored services to their child pornography clients. We then issued multiple warnings to remove all child pornography from their servers, which Freedom Hosting refused to do.
*8:00pm CST on October 15, 2011 despite new security features, we once again infiltrated the shared hosting server at Freedom Hosting and stopped service to all clients.
