==Details==
===The Plan So Far===
DOUBLE THE DATA FORCE

1.  Spam this.  Even Anontalk faggots realize that this is true.  You will be banned quickly, so use the guide within to unban yourself.  Yes, deleting every fucking cookie and changing IP does work.

{{Quote|Because Sysop is a dick. This site would be cool if it weren't for Sysop. He's just a fucking grammar Nazi with some sort of issue with the *chans. If this really were a forum for free speech, there would be no need for moderation. If I get banned, or my post is deleted, this is just proof of his unfair and fucked up censorship. Fuck you, I'll say whatever the fuck I want. If I can't do it here, don't fucking advertise as a forum for free speech.|You}}

2.  Troll liek you have nevar trolled before; Kimmo will be sent into a cycle of RAAAAGGGGGEEE.  Just look at this:
{{Quote|It's completely unbelievable that (nearly) nobody has any interest in respecting this board but instead just shits out one crappy post after another. You WILL be banned when found out — you are NOT being funny, witty, clever or anything else but retarded. Do NOT post here if you are a moron who doesn't know basic English and has nothing of value to contribute. The world really is full of braindead, malicious assholes…|Sysop}}

3.  Using tools like LOIC and Shitnami, we take down his site, even for a short period.  As long as he gets 404, the psychological effect will be extreme.  Like taking a sledgehammer to a chicken egg, this will do damage like no other.  His site will turn against him.  He will be raging at his users.  Then, at the peak of the battle, we fire the lazors and lulz will ensue. 

Time Till Raep

* *FUCKING USE ANONYM.TO FAG*

4.  [[Ruin life tactics]]: pizzas, boxes, letters and male prostitutes turning up at his house will give him the last skull fuck to make him stop.  Letters should contain a standard Anonymous poster, Monopoly Jewgolds as a "donation" and a letter.

{{Quote|There are more trolls than real posters here.|Sysop}}
Damn fucking good work.

==Raid==
Fuck that, this raid is active now. Do it faggots. 


This shit is working, Sysop can be seen bawwing about the companies who shut him down for being a pedophile site

Woot, 404. A SODD attack.

{{Quote|How the FUCK doesn't this great place have hundreds (or even thousands) of active, genuine posters on-line at any given time? HOW? The traffic has even dropped far below what I used to think was low. THERE JUST IS NO TRAFFIC COMING HERE! Isn't it enough to have the best site in the whole world? What the fuck do you WANT? WHY are you never spreading the word?! It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.|Sysop}}

Modest.

{{Quote|So many worthless fucktards — so insanely few genuine people…|Sysop}}

Insulting your fan base does you no good kimmo.

{{Quote|What really grinds my gears: people who write otherwise quality posts but slip an error through by not proof-reading before posting. PROOF-READ! PROOF-READ! PROOF-FUCKING-REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAD!|Sysop}}

Read has too many E's BTW.
