== Details ==

Basically there are a bunch of moralfags running around several cities across the world IRL acting like superheros. 'Nuff said? Fortunately they happen to have a website where they all register and put up information such as links to there myspace and whether or not they are currently active as crime fighters. I first heard about this on the local news, it was some guy running around DC with a roll of quarters calling the cops every time he saw a drug deal.


The main sites are the worldwide registries, the secondary sites are the different leagues they have.

== Raid ==

Step One: [[PsyOps]] <br>
Infiltrate their ranks, have a few people register as a current RL superhero. Can probably find pictures of some gayfag dressed up at ComicCon and use it. Not only could we turn them against any mods they have, but there are a lot of organizations and people that help out these so called heroes (costume designers, etc.).


Step Two: [[Ruin Life Tactics]] <br>
Some of these idiots don't keep their dox secret. The usual free boxes, white canes, and free magazines extravaganza.


Step Three: [[Low Orbit Ion Cannon|DDoS]] and [[Spam]]<br>
When they're confused and retreat to home base trying to figure out who is doing this, DDoS the fuck out of the site and mail bomb all their emails so that they sift through hours of shit just to see if they have contact with their lifeless friends.


Also, because of how retarded and full of fail these people are, it should be easy to employ the help of 4chan's massive amount of /b/tards. Because when all else fails, they can just spam annoying-ass memes all over the forums.

 It's hard to find dox for this guy, but he is everywhere.

If we can find out what the name of his pets are we can gain access to his account, which is an admin account for the main website.

 http://www.cnn.com/2009/LIVING/06/04/real.life.superheroes/ - Looks like the same guy

=== Host of some of them ===
This guy owns the hosting company, his info is on allot of domains so it looks like he is only the admin at the company that hosts some of them.  Called him up "looking for web hosting" and it looks like he also runs a "whois protection service" by putting his info in whois records for people he hosts; Turns out this may just be the dox for an office.  It does not look interesting.
