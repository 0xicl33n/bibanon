 | casus         = A recent raid on a few facebook pages caused a lot of lulz on facebook on a tiny scale. Just imagine more people on a big scale raid can cause a epic butthurt and get media coverage. This is a guaranteed butthurt generator raid due to all the attention whores that friend everyone. These people will sign on and see gore and scat covered on thier news feed with hate/spam comments on everything. Then have massive amounts of butthurt cause of the mess, maybe even hero cause of the embarrassment. 

The ultimate goal is to crack 50,000 facebook accounts and begin a massive trolling campaign to use as a training scenario to start building up momentum in /i/ again, to build up to bigger raids.

=Operation: Shitbook=
<br><br>
== Setup ==

# Signup multiple Facebook accounts (Make your accounts look believable/real. Have a picture, details, etc...)
# Friend as much people as possible on each account for max amount of lulz (Few Hundred Per Account) 
# Create an multiple albums and set the Album Privacy to [Everyone on Facebook = '''UNCHECKED'''] [Friends = '''Only Me''']
# Only upload 2-3 pictures per album, cause on raid day people will only see 2-3 pictures on their news feed per album.
# Tag EVERYONE on each picture. (ONLY ON THE DAY OF THE RAID. SEE PROTIPS BELOW)

== Day of the Raid ==

# November 25th
## Set all your albums Privacy to [Everyone on Facebook = '''checked'''] [Friends = '''Friends of Friends''']
## Spam hate and nonsense comments on peoples pictures and status

== Protips ==

[[Image:1257451226154.png|thumb|right|Preview of whats coming, <br> of the soon to be epic butthurt! <br>(from mini raid)]]

*Search Facebook for "Add me" groups, instantly get heaps of friend whores. (Groups centered on games such as Mafia Whores also work VERY well for friends) (Note: Be sure to get friends outside these groups as well, we don't want Anons friending Anons, spread the attack out.)
*DO NOT tag friends until the raid date. They WILL be informed regardless of privacy level.
*Use a scenefag as your FB profile pic.
*If you're uploading more than one FB profile pic, make sure they are at least similar.
*If you cant find a good pic of a slut, google helps! [http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&um=1&sa=1&q=girl%20model%20portrait Google Image Search]
*Also, [http://browseusers.myspace.com/Browse/Browse.aspx] and [http://anonym.to?http://www.modelmayhem.com/browse.php]
*Make a separate email per account [http://www.10minutemail.com/10MinuteMail/index.html 10 Minute Mail]
*Python 3 download here: http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/
*Cover your ass: [[Tor]]
*This is good too: [[Proxifier]]

== Extra points ==

* Try to hack or make poser accounts of people who are guaranteed to get ton of teenage girls freinding them (Joe Jonas, Robert Pattinson, Johnny Depp etc.) The majority of the accounts for those 3 people have at least 30,000 fans each, even the poser accounts. Also, since celebrities' dox and pictures are everywhere it is easy to fake a realistic looking account.
* There's an app called Farmville, you can post signs on your friends farms. Spam signs and hate messages, it takes forever to remove them all.
* Join groups that allows members upload/share pictures on the groups album for a bigger spread of butthurt.
* Make them fall in love with you, use an attractive profile pic. This way the fall will be much further.
* Competition running up to the raid to see who can get the most friends, post screen shot in thread the day before. Winner gets 2 internet points.

== Another kool idea ==

Instead of mass goatse'ing everyone, this could be used as a potential phishing operation. I went and added fuckloads from the huge "ADD ME!" group last night, 88 new friends overnight. The potential is huge. Don't forget that they will most likely fall for the phisher because they're retards and have already accepted you without knowing you at all.

== Friend Bomber ==
Found this program, should speed up the friend adding process. I ran in a sandbox, and it seems clean, however complete confirmation is needed. If it is confirmed clean, then use only for around 100 friends a day, so as to not arouse suspicion. Make sure to use a fake account, just incase it is a phisher.

- I've used this app before, and it's clean, although there are some issues now with adding on facebook. You have to get your account validated, either with SMS or with a college email. They used to activate you if you joined a network and people confirmed that you were a part of the network, I'm not sure if that still works. Something to think about. Also, if you get the SLOW DOWN notification when you are adding, STOP IMMEDIATELY FOR THE DAY. Remember how many adds you sent out that day, and cut it in about half if you decide to do it the next day. For some reason, Fbook admins are crazy about those kind of things.

-Also, unlike the video, this is not automatic. You have to enter captchas, but it does make it easier.Gathering ID's is also a little different, Normally what I do is go to the add me group(or any other active group), click the wall then gather id's, do the same for info and discussions ( make sure to click on the actual discussions aswell when gathering), when you finish this more people will have posted on the wall, and you can gather their id's. You should have at least 100 by now.

-One Final note, this has a mass messenger and wall poster as well, it should help on raid day.
