== Operation Sly Fawkes ==

Operation Sly Fawkes is a developing raid of epic proportions against one of the most prominent contributors to the sea of bullshit media that the United States is drowning in. Fox conducts itself much like an angry, pimple-faced teenager when they're challenged, and like a massive hairy Goliath covered in oil with machine guns when they're somehow at an advantage. They bitch and moan about liberal media bias and hypocrisy, while actually making any liberal media bias look as harmless as milk and cookies. <s>Fox News is the unlulziest troll ever to exist. They don't actually realize that they're trolling? Somebody alert the media! Oh, wait...</s>

== Moralfaggotry? ==
[[Image:lulz.jpg|thumb||left|Faggots.]]
There may very well be a <s>hint</s> shitstorm of moralfaggotry here, but do not fret, gentlemen. Exploding vans, corruption of LOL, Hackers on Steroids, Internet Hate machine...need I go on? Fox is a lulz factory, and the national channel reaching it's skinny, angry, radically conservative arms around America could be made to deliver a message from us without too much prying. Attacking Fox and watching the response is a deep well full of the quenching waters of lulz, and we must tap into it regardless of whether or not a few <s>conservatrolls</s> newfags label us moralfags.

== Targets ==

'''1. Sean "The Manatee" Hannity'''

Sean Hannity is a hate filled little brat bitch. He grew up a privileged, wealthy Catholic in an area of New York City where you'd be hard pressed to find a <s>black guy</s> nigger who wasn't Michael Steele. His show promotes the worst of radical conservative hate-mongering. Anything from calling Obama a terrorist to bashing minorities, you name it.

'''2. Bill "Billo The Clown" O'Reilly'''

Plain and simple. Bill needs no introduction to Anonymous.

'''3. Ann(tichrist) Coulter''' who supports the United States going on new crusades to convert Muslims to Christianity (Lulzy maybe... But she doesn't work for FOX) (But she is a regular guest on Bill Orly, and other FOX shows)

Retarded attention whore

'''4. Glenn Beck - (That guy who's not Rush Limbaugh but is a chubby conservative prescription junkie. The other junkie.)'''

Glenn Beck is a recovering drug addict, a <s>chubby faggot</s> fatass, a fake libertarian, and a guy who wears sneakers with a suit. Do you really need to know more than that?

'''5. Megyn Kelley'''

Designated Camwhore

== The Plan (TO-DO) ==
(not in any order)<br>
*PROTIP:  Get /b/lackup and call his show.  Ask about battletoads and make it sound like it's some sort of environmentalist group.
*Someone post a video on [http://www.youtube.com Jewtube] demanding that Bill O'Reilly/Glenn Beck quit. Those two are their highest rated, either (A. That's probably not gonna happen and we pwn them or (B. It does for some strange reason and Fox loses a metric shitton of money. Either way, lulz. Also, Goatse. <br>
*DOX DOX AND MOAR DOX NEEDED!  &nbsp;We need to make it so unpleasant for fox news reporters that they quit!  We should not stop until we see a head anchor step down at the minimum.<br />
*Vandalize polls, post results for lulz or rage<br>
*Attack/troll sites they mention and support, when words gets around that whatever they mention goes down, their shit stops to spread<br>
*Massive e-mail campaign to various shows, hit one show on one day, another the next<br>
*Psy-Ops the forums and TV hosts.<br>
*Someone definitely needs to use the "fake garage sale on Craig's List" on Mr. Hannity. Let the lulz ensue. 
*Search the info on the wifes of this guys, then post on Craig's list ad "Married woman looking for sex" post the name, address and phone number. 
*Spam their comment section with casual links to last measure.
