==Details==

This forum has people who pretend to be /b/tards, furfags, twifags and other retards who think they can do '1337 h4x'. Those people use the stuff from /b/ in order to make themselves look cooler. Some pretend to be hardcore trolls and raiders to scare people.
A regular member gets pissed if you bash their fan-fiction, games, etc.
This site does NOT need email verification and it only has one admin for a thousand members. They also don't check topics regularly. 
Mods are very much trollable.

The target's IRC server is:
 irc.epic-chat.org 
 6667 
 #spyrochat

Their IRC is now a bantrap, unless you have a proxy or something to get past the bans. Full of registered fgts and mods.
There is also an exploitable wiki full of Furfags and CircleJerk. Use Goatse and Gore to make their e-peen shrink back to its deformed size. http://anonym.to/http://spyro.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page


Great forum trolling materials:
[http://anonym.to/http://www.spyroforum.com/topic-8853-off-limit-topics.html?sid=c31534d7d969ba4064a7adf6c7b1a546 Thread about banned subjects ]

Do some [[PsyOps]] for a little while and then go crazy.<br>
The first few waves of /i/nsurgents have basically all been G-Lined [Globally Banned from the IRC server].<br>
'''Condoms have been blocked.  See below.'''

The irc faggots all use colors to chat, and get butthurt when you use their color so you can troll them by pasting the below into your mirc remotes, and using one of their colors.
 on *:input:*: {
  if ($left($1,1) != /) {  
    if ($left($1,1) != !) {  
      /say COLORHERE $+ $1-
      /halt
    }
  }
 }

==Defenses==
The mods are somewhat quick to swing the banhammer, but could ''easily'' be overwhelmed.

Their IRC network has an 8 lines per 6 seconds flood filter. Watch out for this if you are spamming it. If you can hack it off with some steroids, then feel free. Break the filter twice, and you get auto permabanned from the IRC network. Update: ban upon entry.

They've locked the site down from the majority of our /i/nsurgents, in attempt to make us think they abandoned it. Do not rest, this faggot is fighting back. We will carry on with the plan.

Condoms, proxies and Tor have now been blocked. If any /i/nsurgents have working proxies, use them, and use them well.

REMEMBER: There is a spy in our IRC. Keep all Top Secret info to yourself or in PMs...

==Raid==
[[File:Spyroforum.png|right]]
#Make a spyfag account or two. 
#[[PsyOps]] on the IRC and Forums ultil we call the main strike. Make original posts to seem like a spyfag.
#When announced, engage massive spam-rape on the forums and IRC. Spam Hueg.jpg thorough the forums to crash their computers.
#Tilt head back and expel massive lulz till you explode.
Remember: The Monday raid was not the final attack, only the attack to bring fear amongst them before we do the final strike. I'm announcing the date for the main raid when the Wiki is able to support it EFFECTIVELY. The reason for this attack is a massive PsyOps on their reaction when we strike. If they manage by any ways to hold or strike back, we will know it when we do the main attack.

NB: Spyroforums is very aware of the attack, thus any new accounts (that includes your sock accs) may get the banhammer even if you haven't done anything yet. Have several [[Proxy|condoms]] at hand (most are blocked). Though, they'll have to banhammer around 50-150 accounts if they want to smash all the /i/nsurgents under their skin. If they did this, they would ban loads of normal accounts, too - meaning epic win for us.


I'm prompting you all to make a spyrofag account and PsyOp the site until I call the main strike. If you want to troll, be VERY CAREFUL. We don't want any /i/nsurgents to be banned and make them stroke their e-penis. Main strike will be called when the wiki is ready.

===Tools===
*'''[http://anonym.to/http://www.mediafire.com/?3m1zikkmlju Spyro Porn Pack]'''
*'''[http://anonym.to/http://spyro.ytmnd.com/ Spyro-Yiff Animation]'''
Use this pack to spam Spyro furries/hentai/cartoons on their forums.<br>
You could also link to it on the IRC Channel.
<br />
*'''[[Tor]]''' / '''[[Proxy]]'''
Don't forget to wear protection when you're doing the really kinky stuff [unlawful].
<br />
*'''[http://anonym.to/http://spamtheweb.com/ul/upload/300509/52704_hueg3.jpg Hueg3.jpg]'''
Hueg3.jpg is an image that hogs a computer's RAM, slowing it down and crashing slower machines. Works wonderfully on 56 kb/s internets.<br>
Post it on your forum signature for great lulz, but don't navigate to the image yourself unless you want to experience self-rape. <br>
It will most likely crash your computer, or at the very least SLOW IT THE FUCK DOWN, so DON'T NAVIGATE TO THE IMAGE, just put it in your sig.<br>
Or you could just do it the easy way:
<br />
*'''Epic Fail Cannon'''

'''Don't use. EFC has aids (trojan). [[Low Orbit Ion Cannon]] for info on that.'''
<br />
*'''Longcat Flooder'''
[http://anonym.to/http://rapidshare.com/files/239431464/Longcat_Flooder_CLIENT_ONLY.exe Rapidshit]<br />
If AV, or any other virus/Trojan scanner detects it as a Trojan, it is a false positive. AV doesn't like DDoS programs or hacked programs for that matter. <br>
(Plus, AV simply scans a 'signature', so it creates false positives quite easily).

 This girl tried to fight back by deleting all her irl information and pics from the internetz. 
 Should we enlighten her how horribly slow she was? 
 Although her banhammer is kinda easy to swing she when she is paranoid (usually caused by a recent troll), 
 she is far one of the  most easiest trollable mods on the forum. 
 Suspected of performing evil vandalizing on the wiki. Stay true, /i/nsurgents!

==To Do==
*'''1''' - Get 4chan involved: I would guess they visit 4chan if they pretend to be /b/tards as you said earlier. Doing this might clue them in.

PsyOps: Drop 4chan into convo when your speaking about trolls, or the IRC attacks.

Trolls: Do what you do best, and troll 4chan's /b/ for all that you have, claiming you're from spyroforum. Use everything in your power to invoke a counterstrike.
If we run out of sock accounts/proxies, DDOS it do death. Also, get the IPs of the fags who keep vandalising our w/i/ki.

This will create ''severe'' lulz.

*'''2''' - Get a DETAILED dox written on high standing users such as Aceedwin and Kjakings.

*'''3''' - Crush the high standing members and make people leave the forum.

*'''4''' - Find a way to destroy the forum by deleting all topics & posts. (Haxxor your way in, and replace all topics and posts with <s>Spyro yiff</s> '''not yiff! 98% of spyrofags have a Spyro fetish!''' gore for maximum lulz potential.)

*'''5''' - Write a dox on Aicebo, RedDragonX and Stormy. Add the pics of Aicebo and Loneknight + find pics of the other two.

*'''6''' - Go friends with Aicebo on Myspace and check all her irl info.

*'''7''' - Dig up trash about Aceedwin.

*'''8''' - Get more detailed info&pics from the site owner and also dig up trash about him.

*'''9''' - Make an EPIC raiding poster.

*'''10''' - Find DOX on spyfag trolls like 84.73.122.99 

*'''11''' - ???

*'''12''' - PROFIT.

==Victories==
Results of the 6/1/09 raid:
* We made them shit their pants because of our "h4x" attempts. Admin login sites got downed.
* They have locked the forum down to prevent any other /i/nsurgents getting in.
* They are banhammering random people in fear of the /i/nsurgents.
* They locked their IRC down and are banhammering everyone who comes in. Caused many lulzworthy situations.

The "raid" as a conversation:
 
 anon: "Lol we will h4x you and we got your dox"
 spyrofags: "OH SHI-" *baleets everything and locks down the sites*
 anon: "Lulz."
 spyrofags: "LOL YOU DID NO DAMAGE. WE BANNED YOU FROM OUR FORUMS: WE WIN THE ANON, BITCH!" 
 anon: *a wall of cool replies*
