'''Here's something to print out and announce. It's a step-by-step synopsis of New Moon, as well as the spoilers for the rest of the series.'''

     CAN I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE. CAN THOSE WHO HAVE NOT SEEN THE FILM OR READ THE BOOKS PLEASE LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY.
  # Jasper, the youngest Cullen vampire, attacks Bella on her 18th birthday.
  # Edward refuses to turn Bella into a vampire because he believes that the souls of vampires are damned and he doesn't want Bella to go that way.
  # Edward dumps Bella and his family move away from Forks. Edward tries to remove himself from her life completely.
  # Bella discovers she can communicate with Edward when she's in immediate danger so she becomes increasingly reckless.
  # Bella meets Jacob and they quickly become friends. Jacob is attracted to Bella but Bella insists on just being close friends.
  # Jacob tells Bella about a gang that he's in, that turns out to be a werewolf pack.
  # Victoria returns to try and kill Bella for the death of her boyfriend in the previous film and Jacob's pack manage to fight her off.
  # Edward gets the message that Bella has killed herself so he asks the Volturi to kill him.
  # When the Volturi refuse, Edward takes his top off to make every girl watching cream themselves, and tries to walk into the sunlight.
  # Bella flies to Italy and stops Edward from killing himself.
  # The Volturi only allow Bella to live if Edward agrees to turn her into a vampire.
  # Edward plans to turn Bella into a vampire after she leaves high school and they get engaged.
     IN LATER BOOKS:
  # Jacob forces Bella to kiss him and she admits that she loves him but not in the way she loves Edward.
  # Edward and Bella get married and Bella gets pregnant during the honeymoon.
  # Jacob "Imprints" on their newborn baby, named Renesmee, meaning that he has found his soulmate.
  # Jacob and Edward eventually see each other as brothers and not as sworn enemies.
  # They all live happily ever after.
     THANK YOU ALL FOR LISTENING. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WAS BROUGHT TO YOU BY ANONTALK.COM
