= Intro =

Twitter hasn't seen a good large-scale Anon raid before except for [http://anonym.to/http://digg.com/celebrity/Help_Basement_Dad_get_1mil_Follwers_and_Beat_CNN_Ashton Operation Basement Dad]. It's about time to change that.

What we will be doing is spamming Twitter with the phrase [http://anonym.to/http://tinyurl.com/dhrtxr #gorillapenis] (# signifies a particular topic on Twitter that is searchable). Yes, it is both stupid and unfunny, but spamming memes would be too obvious, cancerous and AIDS. The idea is to get it to the top of the "Trending Topics" (the list of the most popular topics on Twitter), evoking much lulz.

[http://anonym.to/http://news.buzzgain.com/how-many-tweets-does-it-take-to-be-a-trending-topic-on-twitter Here] is a fancy article on how many users/tweets are needed to be on the Trending Topics.

= Plan =
[[Image:Operationshittermanualinstr.png|thumb|right|350px|Post this on every fucking *chan out there]]
Create scripts (greasemonkey? macros?) or webpages which are easy to use by complete retards (or the raid will fail) and automatically spam twitter with random crap including the #gorillapenis hashtag.

Problems to notice:

* When using the Twitter site, after about 50 messages your tweets might get blocked. They're still successfully sent, but they don't appear in the search and probably aren't counted in the hot topics. Creating a new account fixes that (no IP bans).

* When using your own application hosted outside of Twitter, you can post exactly 150 updates per hour. After that, both the account '''and''' the IP the app was posting from get banned. We will need multiple bots on multiple servers to accomplish our aim.

* Even though Twitter has no email validation, you cannot create accounts with a random email. If Twitter's welcome email doesn't get deliered, your tweets will not be visible in search results and thus won't count towards our goal. Use [http://anonym.to/http://10minutemail.com 10minutemail.com], [http://anonym.to/http://mailinator.com mailinator.com] or [http://slopsbox.com/ slopsbox]


Each anon should have several ways of spamming Twitter:

= Easy instructions =

Instructions for people who either don't have the knowledge or just are too lazy to do anything by themselves. We have instructions for Windows and all UNIX-based systems, including Mac OS, Linux and BSD.

There are two scripts available:
* Script #1 will create three Twitter accounts and spam using them.
* Script #2 will need you to create three Twitter accounts, and will spam using them.

If you have an old Twitter account, perhaps from Operation Basement Dad, use that one. Twitter won't ban older accounts that easily.

Also, if you have the time, it's better not to use ''any'' scripts, but just sit and post a shitload of random crap along with #gorillapenis. That way tweets won't repeat themselves and it will seem a bit more legit.

== Windows ==

=== #1 ===
# Download [http://anonym.to/http://www.mediafire.com/file/njvzyjdzqmn/twitter.zip] and unzip it
# Run twitter.exe
# You will be asked to fill in a captcha three times, after that the script will start spamming Twitter from three different accounts.
# '''After 30 minutes or so, '''(or 15 to be on the safe side) '''change your IP. Restart your router, change proxy, or whatever, just change your IP.'''
# Continue until #gorillapenis is in Trending Topics.
# Profit. This time no '????'.

Note that if you have PHP installed, you may as well follow the instructions for UNIX systems below.

=== #2 ===
# Register 3 (three) accounts on Twitter - no email validation, so it's easy. Use a trashmail email (like something_random@mailinator.com or use [http://anonym.to/http://10minutemail.com/10MinuteMail/index.html 10minutemail]) so the e-mail is valid. Might be useful against their spam detection. You can't just use one account because it will get blocked quickly.
# Go to [http://anonym.to/http://pastebin.com/f60a9d6f0] and save the file (by clicking 'download') as "twitter.php" in C:\Documents and Settings\Your_Username
# Edit the file with notepad, fill in the usernames and passwords of the three accounts you've registered - everything is explained inside the file
# Install PHP 5.3 from [http://anonym.to/http://php.net php.net] ([http://anonym.to/http://windows.php.net/download Windows download])
# Add [[Proxy|proxy]] for anonymity (not necessary, but recommended)
# Open command line (Start -> Run -> cmd.exe)
# Type in ''php -f twitter.php'' and leave it running
# ????
# PROFIT

=== PHP Installation Fail ===
You could also just edit the above script and upload it to some random webserver which supports PHP. Then open the appropriate URL in your browser and let it run.

== *nix / *BSD / Mac ==

=== #1 ===

Install Python (preferably version 2.6) and the [http://anonym.to/http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/#pil116 Python Imaging Library].<br><br>
For Ubuntu and Debian-based distributions (Python should already be installed):
<pre>
sudo apt-get install python-imaging python-imaging-tk
</pre>

Download the [http://anonym.to/http://pastebin.com/f42ecb618 script] and run it:
<pre>
wget "http://pastebin.com/pastebin.php?dl=f42ecb618" -O twitter.py
python twitter.py
</pre>

Remember to change your IP from time to time.

=== #2 ===

Install the PHP and PHP-curl packages.<br><br>
Example for Ubuntu and probably other Debian based distributions:
<pre>
sudo apt-get install php5 php5-curl
</pre>

Download the script and edit it to add your 3 usernames/passwords:

<pre>
wget "http://pastebin.com/pastebin.php?dl=f60a9d6f0" -O gorillapenis.php
nano gorillapenis.php
</pre>
Start it from the command line: 
<pre>
php gorillapenis.php
</pre>

= Manually spamming = 
Create a Twitter account (or use your current one, I'm sure many of you already have it) and start posting random shit; be sure to include #gorillapenis in your every tweet. Put "eBaum's World" as your location (or something similar).

Just post lots of #gorillapenis, that's it.

Fellow Anon suggested using a [http://anonym.to/http://is.gd/1lzVK short link] to make spamming faster.

= Automatically spamming =

== TweetDeck ==

Download [http://tweetdeck.com/beta/ TweetDeck] (Windows, Linux, Mac) and set it up to automatically retweet the messages of other #gorillapenis spammers: <br>'''Mouse over person's pic and click straight arrow icon.'''<br><br>
If you do, make sure to casually check if your tweets are still visible in the [http://tinyurl.com/dhrtxr search]. If not, create a new account.

== Perlbot ==
Create a Twitter account and set up a bot, which avoids having to spend the 9000+ hours typing the words "#gorillapenis", as mentioned above. It is the most efficient way, but, of course, requires some basic web knowledge.

The problem with bots is that the maximum number of hourly updates you can make with an application is 150, which, of course, will clearly not attract enough attention. To bypass this, set up as many bots as possible, allowing you to spam shitloads of gorilla penises on Twitter.

* [http://anonym.to/http://pastebin.com/f7eb56d4e This Perl bot] searches Twitter and retweets every tweet mentioning #gorillapenis.

The bot is really easy to set up on any decent web server, or even your computer. What you will need is Perl with a few additional modules: DBI, LWP and XML::Simple, and a MySQL database (table configuration can be found [http://anonym.to/http://pastebin.com/f7603a8ba here]).

Each bot set up multiplies the amount of crap we'll be spamming, but, obviously, it only works for a while, then it reaches the update limit and you have to wait an hour. We could ask for an official [http://anonym.to/http://twitter.com/help/request_whitelisting Twitter whitelisting], but that obviously has a small chance of success. A great idea would be to set up many bots and let them share a database; that way they would fucking spam Twitter like crazy.
