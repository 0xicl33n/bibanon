Operation: Antfuck 2.0: /b/ is under attack. We need to rally our /b/tard /b/rethren, find out who's responsible, and raep them with the full force of over 9000 penises.

== Raid II ==

Just when we thought the AT&T drama was over, the DDoS against 4chan continues, and AnonTalk seems to be the culprit. In addition, they are getting spammed by the same colored A Clockwork Orange images. Why do we think it was AnonTalk? It's always AnonTalk.

Read the goals correctly. Our aim is not to [[DDoS]] Anontalk.com but to [[BWraep]] and make the hosting costs shoot up high. 

NB! As Kimmo lives with his mom, maybe we could gather dox on her and ruin her life too? This could make her throw Kimmo out or make him stop running this website. <br> (Oh, come on! She's just in the way.  Ignore the inconsequentials.) 
'''LET'S BLAME THE NEXT BIG RAID ON ANONTALK INSTEAD OF EBAUM'S''' <br>
'''Or let's spam random forums with anontalk BS and get a huge cock to rape them.'''

===Goals===
*Life Ruination of Kimmo Alm
*[[BWraep]] against Anontalk.com to drive up Kimmo Alm's bandwidth costs.

===ULTIMATE FUCKING BWRAEP FOR MAC/LINUXFAGS===
 <xero> 5 people doing "hping3 anontalk.com -S -a 4.4.4.2 -i u1 -p 80" when plugged directly into cable/DSL is like having 5000 ddosing
 <xero> it will send a core DNS server crashing down on anontalk
 <xero> i shit you not
 <xero> it sends a spoofed SYN as 4.4.4.2 to Anontalk
 <xero> Anontalk replies to 4.4.4.2 with SYN-ACK
 <xero> 4.4.4.2 replies back with 10 RST packets for each SYN-ACK

'''ATTACK TIME. JULY 9TH. 6 PM EST. FIRE YOUR LAZORS.  [http://anonym.to/http://www.timeanddate.com/counters/customcounter.html?month=7&day=9&year=2009&hour=6pm&min=00&sec=0&p0=179 COUNTDOWN]'''

DON'T DDOS UNTIL THEN. They like to ban, faggots.
Bonus points for Twhor.

Make sure to set your tcp/udp message to "Revenge of the Fallen".

===Details===

Joint Operation: /i/NTERNET /b/OSS is a joint op between 4chan survivors and 888 /i/nsurgents. We will aid the paralyzed 4chan in their fight against ultimate faggotry from Anontalk. All /b/ATTAL/i/ON soldiers, man your lazors!

Anontalk.com DDoS'd 4chan and our Bunker as you all know. This is an unforgivable act. 711chan only hampered our recruitment, they did not attack the /b/unker.-Action Bastard

Stoner faggots are accepting the survivors into their clan, then banning anyone mentioning /i/, even though ''we're'' the ones doing the fighting.

Finding /b/rothers is a priority. Bring them to the bunker if it's up, or /i/ to assemble the '''ALLIED /b/ATTAL/i/ON'''.


====Stage 1: Anontalk, Main Strike Force====

*1. Round up all the /b/rothers and /i/nsurgents you can. This is a priority. Omegle (Omegle has been reported of being filled with AnTfags, proceed with caution) and 420 seem to be the hot spots.

*2. Report in to the bunker with any new information. Fall-back bunker is up: [http://anonym.to/http://bunkerchan.co.cc]. AIM ALL LAZORS HERE:  [http://anonym.to/http://prq.se http://prq.se]. Wait until the specified time to attack.

*3. FIRE ALL LAZORS!

*4. Continue steps 1-3 until results meet our likings. Especially step 1. We need more boots on the ground.

====Stage 2: 711chan, Secondary Target====

==Important Info==
Anontalk bans IPs. How do we get around that?

DDoS their host first, then both at the same time. We have the firepower. Epic Fail Cannon mirror here, it's clean from 888chan: http://anonym.to/http://www.megaupload.com/?d=6784JZ29

==Info from the Bunker==
Vorked, one of the many hard working individuals doing what they can to set things right, was SODD'd offline early into the attacks.
Vorked got back up recently and brought some offending IPs with him. Turns out our good friends over at AT.com were responsible.
So if you want to get proactive, here's a few targets, and Threedog's confirmation that AT is the perpetrator.

'''UPDATE FROM THE FRONT LINE'''


Disregard 711chan as a target and for any attacks on the bunker.
-Action Bastard

Facepalm, 711chan is strictly against raiding chans and it is more likely that the mods would have killed themselves (all of them.)

BunkerChan has just been DDoS'd 8:40 am cst

===Site Information===

==To Do==
REGROUP. The /i/surgency has given us temporary shelter. Find other survivors. Scour other chans, and Omegle. They are out there. Find them.

RAID POSTER.
[[File:InternetBoss copy.jpg]] This work?

/b/unker is back. That is our new home. Check back with /i/ for wiki progress and all the fun shit.


'''July 9, 6:00 EST. MASS FUCKING DDoS on AT. They like to ban. We're going to strike so that they cannot. Focus all lasers on the host.'''

<s>Before firing your lazors, spread [http://anonym.to/http://www.kittehs.tk http://www.kittehs.tk] to everyone and everything. 
Note: hidden nimp</s> - Currently down. .tk expires if you don't get enough visitors, feel free to make a new one if you want.

==Victories==

2:15 AM Eastern Time July 8: Survivors found on /x/ and /b/. Boards are slow, but can be reached. Anontalk is starting to falter.

<del>7:52 AM EST July 8: AT appears to be down</del> No, bro. They just auto-IPbanned you for the LOIC request spam and it sends you to 404. It's still up on my side as well as here: http://anonym.to/http://www.downornot.com/anontalk 

<s>10:13 PM</s> 1:53 AM July 10 Eastern Time: http://anonym.to/http://www.downornot.com/ns.prq.se  host is down as of now, however anontalk remains, keep this up to date

---( How can the host be down but the site stays up? Were we given the wrong place to attack? )---

Newfags! The host was hit hard and AT displayed a database error message for quite a while, then it got back as they banned IP by IP from DDOSing. The onlything that seems to be down is one of their host's name server, they have backups though.

2:38 EST - http://anonym.to/http://www.downornot.com/anontalk.com is reporting that anontalk is down.

2:55 PM EST July 10 - http://anonym.to/http://www.downornot.com/anontalk.com is reporting that anontalk is up.
