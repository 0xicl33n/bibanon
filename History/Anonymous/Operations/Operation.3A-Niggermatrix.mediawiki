[[File:Boss_nigger.jpg|200px|thumb|right|no1hacker; he is [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Noone no1], he hacks [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Noone no1]]]

Greg is the owner of his own "company" LIGATT Security. He has been arrested for [http://anonym.to?http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1365/is_5_33/ai_94672511/?tag=content;col1 conspiracy and wire-fraud charges], a far cry from what Kevin Mitnick, a real hacker has been arrested for. He has been appearing on TV talking his bullshit, especially The History Channel, which will make anyone puke just by watching it. His entire company is a scam, so is his title as No. 1 Hacker, what's worse is that a black guy is an investor in LIGATT security, and we all know that niggers can't hack.

wait wat? [http://anonym.to?http://www.ligattsecurity.net/securitychallenge/rules.htm The LIGATT Security Challenge] ([http://anonym.to?http://pastebin.com/f62c02c84 plain txt mirror]):

# [http://anonym.to?http://www.google.com/finance?q=PINK:LGTT Stock Information] (google.com) about the niggers 'company'. 

Using the current numbers (as of Oct. 24th 2009), LIGATT SECURITY INTL INC is worth $60 USD on the market.  xD what a poor nigger, serves him right. $60 USD isn't much but we need his company to be worth nothing.>:D
It should be noted that the niggers site claims a "Estimated Market Cap: $2,462,436 as of July 27, 2009", where in reality the [http://anonym.to?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization market cap] calculated to only $62,480, this is assuming my understanding of market cap, the stock information from Pink OTC Markets Inc. (c/o Google Finance) is correct, and that my computer's mathematic outputs are correct.  This is still a large amount of money but it is not what their site is claiming, I find it interesting that they chose the date of July 27th. Why fabricate the numbers when only about a month earlier (June 29, 2009) their company had it's largest peak in share volume, 148 million shares! Which (at that time where worth $0.003 each) calculates to $444,000 USD, which is a much larger value then (~7.1x) the $62,480 market cap on June 27th. This peak in share volume may not have been the peak market cap of the company but it seems that way imo, since when the shares were at their highest cost ($0.006 each) on April 22, 2009 (when I assume the company started selling stock, that data starts there), the total market cap value was only $78,900 USD (about 5.6x less then the value at the time of the share volume peak). 

Idk where the nigger got the number $2,462,436, esp. on the date provided. He's had a current max. of 148 million shares but at no time in recent history has any share cost above 6/10th of a cent ($0.006) each. This nigger is pulling numbers out of his ass.

tl;dr He has currently has 100k Shares @ $0.0006 (6/1000th cent) each. The nigs site claims his company was "Founded: 2003" though Google only has stock data starting mid-April 2009 (where his shares stated @ $0.006 (6/10th cent) each, over time the price per share has dropped to much less (you can look at the graphs yourself). It should be noted (imo) that the volume (number of shares in the market) of his stock peaked to ~148M shared near the end of June '09 @ $0.003 each. The volume has moved up and down over time, there was a smaller peak of 117.54M shares (@ $0.001 each) around early Oct. '09. Tomorrow he could have over 9000 or over 9M shares on the market, if a very flexiable number. I would preferif this nigger had a volume of zero shares, but since that's close to impossible to do (look at the way the markets work), I think it would be a obtainable goal to lower this nigger's share volume to 1k or less. Of course we should also be aware of the price of the stock, because 1k shares @ over $9000 is no good either. The best way to do this is to trash his company and reputation in every and all ways possible. =)

==Violations of the GPL, GNU Licenses==
*Needed:<br>
List of violations, sause of programs, sause of point-of-sale, ads, etc.<br>
Letters (personal or form) to copyright holders, developers, software creators, etc. Make sure your srsly pissed about this nigger in your letters a simple 'oh hai thar I saw your software was being sold illegally' might not be good enough, better would be 'FFFFFFFFFFFFuuuuuuuuuuckkk I'm raging man! this nigger stole you shit and it's not cool sez sonic! You should sue that nigger, here's the proof [insert proof].' I'm paraphrasing of course but you get the idea (I hope). 
*How to report this nigger:<br>
[http://anonym.to/?http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#WhoHasThePower Who has the power to enforce the GPL?]<br>
[http://anonym.to/?http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#ReportingViolation What should I do if I discover a possible violation of the GPL?]<br>
[http://anonym.to/?http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-violation.html Violations of the GNU Licenses]<br>

PASTA:<br>
Who has the power to enforce the GPL?<br>
Since the GPL is a copyright license, the copyright holders of the software are the ones who have the power to enforce the GPL. If you see a violation of the GPL, you should inform the developers of the GPL-covered software involved. They either are the copyright holders, or are connected with the copyright holders.<br>

What should I do if I discover a possible violation of the GPL?<br>
You should report it. First, check the facts as best you can. Then tell the publisher or copyright holder of the specific GPL-covered program. If that is the Free Software Foundation, write to <license-violation@gnu.org>. Otherwise, the program's maintainer may be the copyright holder, or else could tell you how to contact the copyright holder, so report it to the maintainer.<br>

---- Remember to talk pretty to the license holders, folks at GNU.org, and other importantfags. no chatspeak, rudeness, memes, or lulz. the law is srs bizness. <br>

Observed a strange flicker in the webpage index.php (rendered in Opera v10), investigated because it was kind of annoying, discovered IFRAME. Exploited if we can take over the iframe or dns to stocktrader.org.uk (unlikely) but if we find a sploit on the stock trader site it could be useful. Spoofem.com's PHP is def. not written by a hacker (or by machine), it's written by a nigger. Just look at the source code, you can tell. Even noticed some oily KFC fingerprints from the faggot in that PHP, like: <!-- /mainbody -->, <!-- /bottom -->, <!-- /maincontent --> and more faggotry close tags without any open tags that have been marked out instead of deleted. @_@<br>
