Operation: After a failed /b/ raid, the emos at http://anonym.to/?http://www.Emopuddle.com/ think they have beaten the anons. Retaliation has been threatened. We need to flex our muscle and show that we will not be stopped so easily.

07/27/09: /b/ tries a general troll flood of the site Emopuddle.com. Admins quickly bring out a instaban hammer, stopping the raid dead.

07/29/09: Admin informs an /i/nsurgent that they have won, and plans to retaliate by spamming /b/ and a possible DDoS attack.

07/31/09: Several users on emopuddle.com say they wish to attack /b/. Legion knows all. /b/ and /i/ counter attack, destroying their chat once more. Admins bring the ban hammers, but hackers quickly find their way into the site, and in less than an hour, emopuddles is replaced with the Canadian flag, national anthem, and this message: July 1st - Canada Day: it's the day canada asked nicely to be removed from british rule and they said yes

8/13/09: Emopuddle finally restores their site and continues plans to attack the mother chan. /i/nsurgents quickly launch a third attack, through the form of LOIC and BWraep. After a brief, 30-minute period of downtime on 8/14, the site is still holding up.

WE WILL BE TAKING THEM DOWN ONCE MORE. SET YOUR LOIC UP AND FIRE TEH LAZORZ ALL NIGHT (10:00 PM 8/17 - 8:00 AM 8/18 EST).

==Details==

/b/ raided the site Emopuddle.com on July 27, 2009. Upon flooding their chat with hundreds of members, the admins brought out the banhammer and booted everyone. The /b/tards gave up hope and fled. Now, the emos think they have won, with one of their admins promising spam to /b/ and possibly ralling support from the other boards he is an admin of for a DDoS attack. 

==Raid==

Being emos, life ruination would probably be best. A DDoS attack to emopuddle.com would probably make them slit their wrists a bit, but they would begin to stablize emotionally once the site came back up and they could bawww about their lives once more. For now, we are gathering dox and trolling their chat. Once a good amount of dox are collected, we hit every individual member. 

tl;dnr: Life ruin emos at emopuddle.com, but do not fire the lazors. Yet.

===Tools===

Google, a working web browser, and the LOIC for later, just in case. Also, dox listed on this page will prove useful.

Necrocious, an admin, quickly deletes his chatango profile, and an anon sweeps it up, registering the name and forever archiving it as an anon victory.
