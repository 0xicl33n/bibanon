==Background==
Hacked by bat0sai
Fuck u porn 
Remember ALLAH .
U ARE A SINNER

[[Feminazis]]. 

Remember our /b/tard Brandon? We launched a mission to rescue him from the clutches of his demented mother and combat the Radical Feminist hoards. While the former demonstrated little success, the latter proved the power of our Legion.

This time, we show the Feminists that this is OUR INTERNETS; their kind will not be tolerated.

This time, we hit them where it hurts; their VAGINAS! No more will their propaganda known as the Vagina Monologues infest our campuses. No more will men across the globe take blame for "crimes" we did not even commit.

Fuck the Feminists! Operation F/i/STING GO!

==The Play==
The Vagina Monologues is lesbian rhetoric created by a batshit Feminist named Eve Ensler. Why the fuck do Feminists call themselves Eve?

TVM follows three different women involving numerous acts and skits. One of the most significant is a story involving a 16-year-old girl (originally written as 13), who gets drunk with an older woman. The older woman date rapes the 16-year-old, but the latter takes it so well, she becomes a lesbian, believing men will not pleasure her like a lesbian will.

Before digressing any further, TVM, despite its blatant misandry and more-than-subtle agenda as a Feminist platform, won numerous awards throughout the Arts.

==Primary Targets==
*Eve Ensler - The Cunt that started it all.
*[http://anonym.to/http://newsite.vday.org/meet-vday/v-men/okun Rob Okun] - Castrated at birth
*This douchebag - <s>Desperate to get laid</s> Desperately gay:

==Methods==
[[Image:Bwraep_vday.jpg|right|current method]]
<s>Currently, we're firing LOICs at the mainsite. Further developments will be posted.</s>

Just [http://partyvan.info/index.php?title=BWRaeper.NET BWRaep them]. No need to DDoS when we can give them OVER 9000 dollars in bills. (their host takes 5$ per every gig that goes over 6) just imagine the look on their vagina's when they see that!

<s> Update - Is their site down for anyone else? Or did i just get v&?</s>
Disregard, I suck cocks.  Got IP banned.

Use [http://anonym.to/http://freetexthost.com/y5px5qicyh this list - UPDATED AGAIN] of URLs with BWRaep. - <s>LIST UPDATED: they were kind enough to upload a 800K PDF yesterday, speeds should be around 1.6 MB/s with this list.</s> They have added a 5MB PDF now, oh LAWDY!

<b>Estimated BW raeped</b>: 802 gigs (add to the number every time you pause/stop BWraeper)

At 5$ per gig that is: $4010 confirmed so far (but with many anons raeping w/o adding to the number here, it could very well be much more)

Or you can pizza flood the bitch, please help yourself with the Delicious Dox.
