==CyberDyne Solutions==

Under Project Skynet, CyberDyne Solutions will be it's constructive operation.
To achieve and post useful relevant information on current situations on Censorship and not the Internet as a whole. Giving tutorials on bypassing firewalls, showing how to effectively use a proxy, You-tube videos of relevant interest in censorship.

To be the most informative relevant to Internet censorship.

Ways of interwebz censor:
 - DNS Blacklist (like Denmark, Norway, Sweden)
 - Singel ip/domain Blocking ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPAvg6CU6sI look around the would])
 - great Firewall (with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_packet_inspection Deep packet inspection](DPI) for a better filter)

==CyberDyne's Watchlist==
*Australia
**We have unfinished business. We must create destructive operations once we get shit moving.<br>
<br>
*South Africa
**Could be doing the same thing that Australia is trying to do.<br>
<br>
*Comcast
**Forget the monopoly. They have have been caught censoring political material. And censoring '''internet traffic'''. This will <s>not</s> go without punishment. <s>Destructive operations soon to come</s>. ''Lost interest. If you want something to happen and you have ShitCast. Then do something.''

Shamelessly taken from The Army's /net/ board:<br>
"If the deal goes through, Comcast — a terrible cable and broadband provider — will become a terrible content provider, absorbing dozens of cable networks and 27 television stations, influencing 200 NBC affiliates and even owning a few theme parks (yes, theme parks).

It would be the biggest media takeover in a generation. Our cable and Internet bills could skyrocket. Sites like Hulu and popular TV programming could get locked behind a paywall<br>

===How to use Tor===
Tor is a network of virtual tunnels that allows people and groups to improve their privacy and security on the Internet.  <br>
It also enables software developers to create new communication tools with built-in privacy features.  <br>
Tor provides the foundation for a range of applications that allow organizations and individuals to share information over public networks without compromising their privacy.

===IS Your ISP using DPI ?===
[[File:Switzerland text logo.png]]<br>
test it with [http://werebuild.eu/wiki/Switzerland_Network_Testing_Tool Switzerland] is an open source network-monitoring utility developed and released by the [http://www.eff.org/ Electronic Frontier Foundation]. 
Its goal is to monitor network traffic between two systems running Switzerland to see 
if the user's internet service provider is violating network neutrality, 
like Comcast does with the BitTorrent protocol. 

===IS Your ISP using DNS Blacklist?===
To check this, use the java TOOL [http://code.google.com/p/dnsprobe/ dnsprobe] <br>( works on *unix ,Windows even on MacOX)<br>
DNS Probe is a tool to compare DNS answers. Multitreading DNS query comparator. Very Fast (>1000per/min).<br>
coded by Anonymous for Anonymous. <br>

=== Surfing blind (none text only pics) ===
If you invoke a pici-server a form field appears to fill in a web address. <br>
The pici-server then creates an image of that website and sends this back.<br>
To make surfing on that image possible, pici-server analyses the web site and puts links via image maps onto the image where they can be seen on the web site. <br>
So one can click in the web browser with the mouse onto the links like on the “true” web page. <br>
On a further layer form fields are set pixel accurately into the web site. <br>
Therewith you can send simple form fields and search as usual within web sites and search engines.<br>
That’s important because for example Goolge is reachable in China, but censors search results. <br>
Search engines outside China show many more results. <br>
Page content, page title, image name, links etc. chooses picidae arbitrarily. <br>
For that the primarily requested URLs can’t be detected by censorship programmes, <br>
user’s input is encrypted by javascript before sending.<br>
