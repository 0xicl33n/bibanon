--I'm pretty sure this is legit:  Quoted from wikipeida "The government's own sites are not in the .kp domain and all are hosted outside Korea; the korea-dpr.com address resolves to DINAHOSTING, a Spanish provider, and the IP location is Germany." http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.kp#cite_note-4

==Victories==

===First Raid===
First attack was a success.  Site was down from 9:00-9:30 Korean time.  A new attack will be planned once this one clears up.  We may want to look at getting more creative this time.  DDoSs are nice, but if someone can hack into the server that would be very lulzy.  Also, look into the site's forums and what you can do there.

-Indeed, the first attack was a partial success; the site was down for while we were attacking, but back up the moment we stopped. Hell, we don't even know if somebody noticed it was gone! Better luck next time. Try to spread the word, we're gonna try again next week! Keep an eye out in the raid board on 888chan!
