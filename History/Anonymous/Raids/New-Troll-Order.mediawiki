==Information==
There is much newage faggotry going on these days just asking to be trolled. Mayafags, and various newagefags are spreading rumors about impending doom supposedly happening in 2012. New Agefags, and Mayafags are all into crackpot conspiracy theories, and taking them down will surely convince them that somebody is trying to stop "the truth." This will also have the added side effect of removing all the 2012 bullshit from the interbutts.

==Targets==
[[File: Stewart_Swerdlow.jpg|right|250px|!]]

An ideal initial target would be Stewart Swerdlow. He's not as big as David Icke, but has quite the sizable following and is just as lulzy. While he is most certainly in it for the money, he more likely than not actually believes he has psychic powers. He is most notable for:

* saying that Teletubbies was used by the Illuminati to brainwash children
* claiming that the buggers from Enders Game and Starship Troopers are teaming up with the Kilrathi from Wing Commander (I'm sorry, KILROTI) and a tl;dr of other aliens in a coalition referred to by newage fags as the Kuiper Belt Aliens that are going to OH NOES invade the Earth with 9000+ ships
* that envisioning yourself in a violet tetrahedron at the center of an octahedron will an impenetrable shield of ultimate protection
* lots of tl;dr newage shit that everyone else is spewing out their asses
* lying about some of and/or stealing the above from other newage sources and taking them as his own
* being a convicted felon (or at least being accused as such by his few critics)

The best way to get at him IMO would be to target the company run by himself, his wife, and their office . 

==Strategy==

===Derp Derp OS===
BWRaep will take away Swerdlow’s precious Jewgold

===Actual Trolling (not fail)===
* Troll followers
** Check youtube subscribers
** Facebook fans

* [[Ruination]], after we find his [[dox]]
** Oder Battletoads from their hotline
** Pizzabombs

===Special Plan===
He is clearly batshit.  Because of this, it is easier to subtly troll him by causing him to rant on inane things.  Try to get him to connect obama or the tea party to the illuminati, for instance, and reproduce his works elsewhere.  Use his (and his follower's) craziness against them.  Sneak comments playing on the craziness (see: Poe's Law) into his Q&A.

==Dox==

Although we don’t have his personal dox yet, we have those of his company
