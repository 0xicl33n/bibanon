{{Quote|Also for the rest of the summer, we're encouraging everyone to write about 4chan without hesitation.|Gawker on why we have rules 1 & 2}}

=Don't endlessly refresh their articles=
If you've already read it, don't read it again.  The more you read it, the more jewgolds the authors get, read them from the gallery below, that way they won't profit from their trolling.

=The Offense=
Some authors on Gawker have decided that it is their life's duty to report on every single inane thing that happens on 4chan, in a fashion reminiscent of CNN streaming whatever some retard says on Twitter.  In a gross violation of rules 1 and 2, moreover, they have called for increased reporting.  If only 4chan's /b/ were self-contained to cancer--but alas!  It spreads to other boards.  We ought to prevent this in the future.

==Lulzkilling==

More importantly, the authors, and some idiots on 4chan, have been lulzkilling some raids by reporting them--with screencaps--to the media or targets.  This cannot be accepted.  Somehow, newfags at 4chan have been trolled by gawker into thinking that only summerfags raid, and in an attempt to fit in with oldfags, try to fulfill gawker's definition of 'oldfag': one who doesn't raid.  Dipshits and cockmuchers, all.

The User: ELFNINOSMOM has posted a link to this post on [http://anonym.to/http://gawker.com/5592050/4chan-hackers-attack-gawker-again Gawker.com's article].  
This self-important hick legal assistant from West Virginia (Eurofags, see Dumbfuckistan meme) was ebaums's most aggressive, overconfident critic in the Gawker comments. She also looks like our weakest target because she has no sense of humor, overestimates her own intelligence and although she thinks she is a 1337 e-privacy expert, there are a fucking buttload of dox about her OTI.

THIS NIGGER MUST PAY.

==Other Commenters==

As discussed above, Gawker admins and bloggers benefit from raids in the sense they benefit from pageviews.  A more efficient way to interfere with Gawker's business model is to target individual commenters pretty much at random.  /I/nsurgency research shows that Denton like most media jews is extremely gay for web 2.0.  He wants to turn his blog network into a social network.  Troll Gawker by reminding its users that when you login using your facebook account and IRL name then post comments goading Ebaums you are asking to be raped.  

To start with, '''here are a few low-hanging fruit. Poast additional commenter dox  as they are found.'''

All this will do is take them down for 30 seconds, and then probably cause a surge in traffic due to coverage by other sites.  Instead, use the dox and proceed to ruination.  See [[Operation Jewgold]] for a correctly run personal raid.  That said, if you can manage by some means to take it down for some length of time, it is still win.
