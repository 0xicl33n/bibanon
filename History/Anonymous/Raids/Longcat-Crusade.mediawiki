The Longcat crusade began after [[Subeta]], a bastion of furfaggotry, stole the beloved Longcat. What followed was a month and a half long siege of [[Subeta]] by elements of (at least some) 2chan, 4chan's /b/, 7chan's /i/, 420chan's /i/, 11chan's /i/, and others. The crusade initially culminated with the capitulation of the [[Subeta]] owner, Keith, the removal of longcat, and a lengthy apology to both his users and the chans.

=Timeline=
==March 17, 2004==
[[Keith Kurson]] starts a virtual pet site called [[Subeta]].org. Many rabid fans claim there is NOTHING similar between [[Subeta]] and Neopets, but the rest of the logical world, including Neopet's attorneys, thought otherwise.
==April 25, 2007==
===The post heard 'round the world===
Keith makes Longcat as an available item on his page [[Subeta]].org. A fellow anon posts the alert on 4chan's /b/.

The alert thread grows and anon decides to flood [[Subeta]] to complain about the incident. After taunting posts made by Keith on the [[Subeta]] home page like this:

Anon is enraged and Raep and JMeter attacks increase.

All threads about raids on [[Subeta]] are quickly removed by moot of 4chan, and raid headquarters is restationed at 420chan's /i/nvasion board.

===[[Subeta]] attacks===
[[Subeta]] poorly attempts a lame DoS attack on 420chan, even going so far as to state, "give it up you stupid niggers, the longcat stays" in [[Subeta]]'s source code:

Gasp! He forgot to capitalize Longcat! Outrage continues to grow.

    I just blocked a DDoS attempt that came from 3 IPs, quickly blocked.
    75.126.139.59
    75.126.139.60
    75.126.139.58
    Going to http://anonym.to/http://75.126.139.60/ reveals a site.

Probes of the originating IP reveal [[Subeta]] as the origin. Intelligence operations against site begin, revealing owner and address (initally thought accurate, later updated). IRC command post activated, though it runs into problems as security concerns result in mass b&s. 420chan thread becomes de facto alternate command post.

===Account info released===
Using account info released three months earlier due to flimsy [[Subeta]] security measures, anon basically rapes [[Subeta]] from the inside using a 200k password list released to Anonymous. [[Subeta]] counters by demanding reset of all passwords. Admins deny attack against 420chan. xchan raep and jmeter attacks continue. Attempts against user email, myspace, blogs, etc. begin using [[Subeta]] password list.

==April 26, 2007==
===Testing the waters===
[[Subeta]] begins to go down 1-2 times per hour. Raep and jmeter continue. Botnets/scripts released as available. [[Subeta]] taunts.

===[[Subeta]] makes ridiculing post on front page.===

    "We've been having some troubles all day today (nothing we can't handle), so to make up for it,
    the Donation Center has been filled with special items! The longcats are especially abundant."

===moot's out===
All threads about raids on [[Subeta]] are quickly removed by moot of 4chan, and raid headquarters are re-stationed at 420chan's /i/nvasion board for instructions.

==April 27, 2007==
===Working down the structure===
Intelligence begins targeting [[Subeta]] admins. Two identified in PW list -- email, myspace, and other accounts attacked and overtaken. Fansites are also targeted.

===PsyOps, GO!===
PsyOps begin; [[Subeta]] IRC infiltrated. Keith taunts Anonymous again.

    Anonymityisfun (23:02:39): Well, you know what day tomorow is, right? That's when /b/ will be in full force if anything.
    "Keith Faggot" (23:02:52): It's caturday!
    "Keith Faggot" (23:03:02): We've got a whole slate of longcat items to release.
    "Keith Faggot" (23:03:09): along with his arch nemesis and speedycat. :]

===More IRC===
Second IRC command post established at quakenet. Attempts to rally support from 2chan begin.

===Enemy identified===
Keith's real home address and PayPal information identified. Also, admins.

==April 28, 2007==
==="Maintenance"===

[[Subeta]] goes down...probably for scheduled maintenance. Comes back up 30 mins later and is besieged. Web page goes down hard 20 minutes later...servers still up, so raep continues. [[Subeta]] claims (on their "down for maint page") that the chans are having no effect, despite clear evidence to the contrary. Message is adjusted 15 minutes later to include a taunting reference to longcat.

::''"Our database upgrade is almost complete. ALso for all the 4chan fans out there, we has this on our webpage for the last couple hours. learn to read. Your EPIC WIN, is our downtime to install more database nodes. gg"'' 

Right. That's why your server has all its threads tied up in write cycles.

The next update on [[Subeta]]'s front page:

::''"Our database upgrade is almost complete. All the extra LOOOOOGCATS forced us to upgrade to hold them all! Also for all the 4chan fans out there, we had this on our webpage for the last couple hours. learn to read. Your EPIC WIN, is our downtime to install more database nodes. gg"''

===More downtime===
An hour and a half later, the [[Subeta]] servers go down hard.

    Ping #2: * [No response]

    Brenton: You fools do realise you'll never bring [[Subeta]] down? You can keep trying, but keith will just keep upgrading the site again and again and again, 2007-04-28 7:26 AM
    Little Dude: OMG! Theres like a billion idiots bragging about [[Subeta]] being down on here whats the big deal! 2007-04-28 7:32 AM
    Brenton: Littledude, people from 4chan and the such have been trying to get [[Subeta]] to die, completely, because they hate petsites. 2007-04-28 8:00 AM
    Brenton: They've also done some other things, which I dont want to make public. they suck though, that can be public. 2007-04-28 8:01 AM

===Mystical[[Subeta]] forum raep===
"Brenton," the owner/admin at Mystical[[Subeta]], taunts Anonymous. Push button, receive raep. Forum raep commences. However, Anonymous sets its sights a little higher for Mr. Brenton.

    IN ADDITION, Brenton the admin had this to say to me.
    "Am i supposed to be scared?
    Haha, keith hosts mee, and my bandwidth is unlimited. fuckhead."
    Im not after bandwidth.

===Mystical[[Subeta]] annihilated===
Anonymous gains access to Mystical[[Subeta]] in toto and rages as only anonymous can. Forums are remamed, images replaced, anonymous FTP access is opened, JB folders are filled.

A contributor sent this e-mail to Brenton (admin of the forums at time of first invasion):

::"Hi Brenton!
::You may remember me as EricBawwwwwwwman from your forums?
::Anyway, I told you this could have all been avoided. You know.. your website and all?
::You don't know what's going on? Oh.. Let me give you a rundown of tonights events!
::We started spamming your forums early on - warning you of what was to come. You refused to cooperate and instead mocked us. Spamming intensified and two hours later your forum was hacked. Background images were replaced and moderator forums unlocked. Guest accounts were enabled next and images were replaced with scat. Next a new subdomain was set up and copious amounts of child pornography was uploaded (http://anonym.to/http://www.mystical[[Subeta]].info/Jailbait) and your homepage was redirecting people to ebaumsworld.com. Next shit hit the fan and forums were deleted, your site was deleted and ultimately in the end, taken down completely. Brenton this could have all been avoided - actually.. no! It couldn't have. Anyway Brenton, I sent you this email to let you know that [[Subeta]].org has been taken down along with your furfag fansite Mystical[[Subeta]].info and you are now famous. Yep! Famous! ED will be updated shortly and you will be known throughout the interbutts as the biggest asshat admin ever.
::GJ.
::Enjoy your night and have another beer for me ;)
::EricBawwwwwwwman"

===Paranoia===
Keith realizes that Anonymous has PsyOps in his IRC and starts banning everyone he doesn't recognize.

===[[Subeta]]Designed===
[[Subeta]]Designed is identified. Shoutbox and image raep begins immediately.

    The truest form of furfaggotry, I mean, just look at that "ready for anal" banner.
    I propose we attack everything [[Subeta]]! Maybe scorning their name will make them wise up.

===Keith in IM===
Anonymous gets Keith into chat on AIM. He confirms the attacks that he and his admins have been denying have been occurring.

===MySquirrel===
[[Subeta]] returns, and includes taunting messages in its main page source code. In said message, [[Subeta]] denies the claim that that it was a "kernal failure" and switches to "mySQL failure as a result of memory upgrade."

==April 29, 2007==
===Longcat LiveJournal===
[[Subeta]] changes their source code message. Still taunting. Still inflammatory.

The infamous Longcat is Looooooooong LiveJournal is posted and creates IMMENSE outrage. It is unknown whether it was truly created by Keith or if it was a fabrication. Nonetheless, it was a reflection of Keith's attitude and only served to bolster the population's interpretation of his cocky ego.

    Kirtaner 07/04/29(Sun)03:43 No.39153
    sup /b/, /i/?
    longcat got a livejournal since he came here
    visit it!

===Rotting from within===
[[Subeta]] members begin to get wary...begin to leave. Raep continues.

    Laura 07/04/29(Sun)14:50 No.39526
    Hilarious. He is asking for it.
    In addition to his bandwidth bill being high, his members are getting scared and starting to leave. Win-win situation here.
    Double the attacks.

===More lies and excuses===
Keith places awkward "explanation" of sorts on the main page. Explains that 4chan and 420chan are out to get them because of Longcat, yet fails to explain reasons for system downtime, or reveal the taunting in the source code.

    Kirtaner 07/04/29(Sun)17:39 No.39656
    By now -- if you don't know already -- there's a bit of a war going on in the beautiful, usually peaceful land of [[Subeta]]. Why, you ask? The answer to that is simple. We'll take the time, now, to explain it to you as best we can.

=Afterwards=
What followed was a siege and raep that seemed never to cease. The raep carried over into Gaia Online, and many [[Subeta]] users found themselves sans Gaia accounts after the release of several thousand usernames and passwords. Then anon from 420 chan managed to hack the sites domain and replace the sites main page with a picture of the prince of bell air box set. The destruction finally culminated in Keith conceding defeat and taking down Longcat. By the terms of the surrender, he was also to post an apology, which he did. The wording of the apology was in some dispute, but finally was to anon's liking. Most combatants stood down at this time.

=The Destruction=
[[Image:Yay.gif|right]]
The destruction of the domain itself, as well as the acquisition of all of Keith's personal sites and email occurred some time after Epic Win had been declared. Anon does not forgive nor forget, and several anons acquired access to emails and sites resulting in the deletion of Keith's domains.
