=Backstory=
'''''<s>Paul Griffiths is far more amazing than most of the fucks who want to ruin his business. Don't be jealous cause he is successful.</s> :O'''''

=Simple Instructions=

He has a lot of fans in a special club called "The Club Kids" which are basically the most fantastic people alive

=Exploits=
The following exploits have been found:

*'''XSS on website'''
**The primary sales site (www.bbycks.com) is prone to a XSS vulnerability:
***[http://anonym.to/http://www.bbycks.com/shop/newsletter.php?list_email_add=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%22Whoops%20XSS%22%29%3C/script%3E http://www.bbycks.com/shop/newsletter.php?list_email_add=<script>alert("Whoops XSS")</script>]
**This could be used to spread propaganda as if it came from the website, or steal cookies for admin-login pages (if there are any).

=IRL Targets=
His store is a potential target 
I suggest that on the night before the raid the 31st of October (or any fucking chance you get), if possible, a group of anons should go to the store and cover the front with newspaper using wall paper paste. It wouldn't be too damaging, but possibly fucking funny as hell. Then, spray paint over the newspaper some funny captions '''''but no fucking memes.'''''
