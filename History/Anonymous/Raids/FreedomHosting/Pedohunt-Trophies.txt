#OpDarknet Official Release -- 10/30/2011 - Pedo hunt trophies, Bear Rugs for Mike Perry

In our last battle against Pedo Fort aka Freedom Hosting, we scored a major victory against the army of child pornographers.  We were able to use 'The Legion' and 'Chris Hansen' to level pedo fort for over about 30 hours.  To our shock, the community of pedos were able to quickly regroup and rebuild Lolita City and Freedom Hosting within a week.  While us Anons regrouped to plan a new strategy, the World suddenly became aware of our little war against child pornography.

Amiss the publicity, the pedos collaborated and dreamed of schemes for ways to disprove Operation Darknet.  False stories were planted against the IT community about us Anons didn't "hack" Freedom Hosting and Lolita City.  What the pedos didn't realize was that we actually took a secret treasure chest from their pedo fort.  We worked silently for weeks to try and crack the lock containing this treasure that the pedo bear was diligently trying to protect.

At-last, we cracked the lock and found the true identity of the builder and architect of Freedom Hosting.  What we found was truly shocking, it was the deeds to a California, USA 'shell' company for 12 Tor Exit Nodes named Formless Networking LLC.

What we found was troublesome, a "tax" lawyer with no CPA and a degree in "Social History and Japanese Language" from Carnegie Mellon?  So we decided to do a little call to this "tax" lawyer.

We pretended we Anon was the billing department at Applied Operations LLC.  We were able to convince Mr. "Tax" Ninja to help explain why a company with a website with no business activity has 12 IP's and with a total speed of 10 GB/s.  Realizing that something was a muck, the Mr. "Tax" Ninja dropped a name of "Mike Perry" from the Tor Foundation.  From there things got became clearer.

	"For the past three or four years now I've led something of a double life."
	"By day, I'm a reverse engineer and developer at Riverbed Technology. There, I'm part of a small team that reverse engineered and accelerates the Microsoft Exchange email protocol, but the company does much more than that, and I feel pretty safe saying I'm surrounded by some of the brightest engineers on the planet. It's actually a pretty neat place. Not evil (yeah, actually for reals), not (too) corporate, very fun staff, etc."
	"But, by night, I do basically whatever I can to help improve privacy, security, censorship resistance, and the ability for people to opt-out (if only temporarily) of the massive surveillance apparatus that is now the modern Internet."
	"I work extremely hard at the things that are important to me, but at the same time, I don't believe in taking anything too seriously, and have a pretty cavalier outlook towards life in general."
	"I also refuse to create a facebook account, a flickr account, a livejournal account, a twitter account, and generally join the web 2.0 party. It makes me sad in a way, because I really like parties, and I also really like new technology, but the astounding amount of personal information these places collect, sell, and use to target their users with ads and profiling i just too much for me"

Wait......  what????   Tor Button Developer, IT guru, PHP Developer, Security + Hacker......., a side company belonging to Mike Perry running 12 Tor exit nodes?????  What is going on here?????  So we dug a little deeper.

	dun 	- but when it comes to PHP i'm concerned about security problems (some script however shows the real server ip to the user and youre screwed)
	dun	- at least i havent found any detailed information on that yet
	dun	- i'd really like to know how freedom hosting solved that
	dun	- (yes, i'm not into php at all)
	nsa	- or: mikeperry committed revision 21556 (/projects/todo):
	nsa	- or: Point out my consensus bandwidth weight branch is ready for
	nsa	- or: review.
	cheako	- Does every exit node need to have access to the hidden service?
	cheako	- dun: You can use port forwarding trickery so apache and php think the servers address is 127.0.0.1
	cheako	- A handfull worked.
	phobos	- hidden services run within the tor network
	phobos	- they don't need exit nodes at all
	phobos	- and by within, tor clients can host hidden services as well

We found ourselves confused....  stuff about hidden services, tor, a 'shell' company named Formless Networking LLC owned/managed by Mike Perry with no other business than Tor Exit nodes?  Shall we look at our records of data pull from our hacks against pedo fort, aka Freedom Hosting?

	Freedom Hosting Server data phpinfo():
	SERVER_SOFTWARE: Apache
	SERVER_NAME: xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion
	SERVER_ADDR: 10.0.1.2
	SERVER_PORT: 80
	REMOTE_ADDR: 10.0.1.2

	http://fscked.org server data:
	Server: Apache/2.2.3 (CentOS)
	X-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.17

	http://www.freedomnetworking.net server data:
	Server: Apache

So......  

	1) Freedom Networking LLC has the Apache backend.  
	2) Freedom Hosting server has ngnix front cache to proxy a backend Apache with PHP safemode on...  
	3) Tor Security expert who fixed hidden service IP enumeration bugs
	4) Freedom Server has as business IP internal NAT of 10.0.1.X
	5) Mike Perry quit Riverbed Technology for Tor in 2008 and Freedom Hosting has a copyright of 2008.  (Src: http://fscked.org/blog/farewell-riverbed-so-long-and-thanks-all-bits) and (http://s1.postimage.org/k8gmi740d/freedom.png)
	6) Mike Perry run's 12 Tor exit nodes under a shell company under Formless Networking LLC
	7) Formless Networking LLC has a "tax" attorney with no CPA
	8) Mike Perry designed Tor Button and is a major contributor to Tor Hidden Node design: https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-07/Perry/Whitepaper/bh-usa-07-perry-WP.pdf
	9) Mike Perry has stated on his personal website "For the past three or four years now I've led something of a double life"

We ask you Mike Perry, what do you have to hide behind your little "shell" company?  You have no Facebook, Twitter, or any data of you on the clearnet, and the only facial data we have about you is a video about your talk at Defcon 16.  The only public data we have was obtained through your "tax" lawyer.  You are a major designer and architect of Tor Hidden services + the Tor button.

You have the motive to hid any illegal activity such as hosting CP behind a company.  You hire an attorney to handle all matters regarding Tor through this Formless Networking LLC.  You know Tor enough, are an IT security guru to able to lock down Freedom Hosting after launching 'The Legion' on the server, you are probably the only one in the Tor Foundation that has the technical knowledge to build a dynamic Tor .onion addressing hosting service running on PHP aka Freedom Hosting.

We ask you Mike Perry.  Why are you trying so hard to be Anonymous, like us?

We are Anonymous.
We are Legion.
We do not forgive.
We do not forget.
Expect us.
