Hahah. By involved, I guess you mean "mentioned near?" This post seems
to provide exactly enough evidence to clear me from having anything to
do with Freedom Hosting.

If you pull the netcraft data for any of my servers going back 15
years, you'll see I've never put a *BSD machine on the Internet. You
will, however, find me trolling various BSD mailinglists about
installer issues, lack of update authentication, build issues, and
poor driver support.. You see, I've never even gotten the shit to
install on anything other than one computer I found in a dumpster, and
it had a broken ethernet driver that I could not even recompile the
source to fix. I reinstalled the computer with a proper OS, and then
put it back in the dumpster.

I suspect I'm just being trolled because I seem to be interested in
personal and legal insulation for my professional activity. Why am I
interested in that? Oh I dunno, maybe because I work on an anonymity
network and run some of its exit infrastructure, and I knew that
sooner or later it would mean having to deal with trolls like these,
or worse?

Anyways, I'd like to thank "Anonymous" for clearing my name, even if
they did have to do so in the most libelous way they could come up
with :). Good show, guys. Good show. *slow clap*.

Yeah, the whole network. Way to read between the lines on some solid
investigative reporting. Pastebin: It's like the New York Times. You
can take that shit to work.
