As bear hunting season came to a close, we the Anonymous hunters grew weary of waiting for big brother to protect us with their words of encouragement.  As we waited, silently, we thought we may have caught the glimpse of a pedo for the hunt.  But no, it was pedo bear who was brought back from the dead despite our previous attempts to send pedo bear against the kiddie porners.  

Pedo bear came at us with vengeance, we had no choice but to load THOR for to end the hunt of #opdarknet.  We found that the darksite FreedomHosting was the major provider of darknet CP sites, including the popular Lolita City.  

We took our tracking equipment and set traps.  Despite our endless looking, we could not find pedo bear.  We recruited many supporters and 'The Legion' to help track down pedo bear.  

First we took am at The Hidden Wiki for their inability to delete the links to the child porno links on the hidden 'Hard Candy' page.  Second we found that FreedomHosting was overlooking that a majority of the 100 GB of data was Child Pornography on it's server.  We took our brave Anonymous members with THOR loaded knowing the pedo bear was hiding in the walls of the pedo fort (http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion).  

We broke down the heavily fortified door of the Pedo fort.  We cocked THOR and fired Nyan Nyan bullets in every direction.  After a bloody battle with trolls, pedos, and pedo bear, we Anonymous became victorious.  What was left of pedo fort, pedo bear, and fellow pedos was a 100 mile hole.  Lolita City and it's neighboring 40+ pedo strongholds were destroyed.

We prevailed.  We do not forget, and we will continuously fight for the idea.  #opdarknet

We are Anonymous.
We are Legion.
We do not forgive.
We do not forget.
Expect us.
