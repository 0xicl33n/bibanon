This is a story all about how<br>
The BNP got flipturned upside-down<br>
I'd like to take a minute<br>
Just sit right there<br>
And I'll tell you all about how dox are in the air<br>
In Western Europe, born an raised<br>
Waltham Cross is where I spent most of my days<br>
Chillin out, hatin, ragin all cool<br>
shootin some niggers outside of the school<br>
when a couple of jews, they were up to no good<br>
started making trouble in my neighborhood<br>
got in one little fight and Griffin got scared...
