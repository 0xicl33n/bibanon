{{Quote| To-day it is hard and almost impossible for me to say when the word 'Emo' first began to raise any particular thought in my mind. I do not remember even having heard the word at home during my father's lifetime. If this name were mentioned in a derogatory sense I think the old gentleman would just have considered those who used it in this way as being uneducated reactionaries. In the course of his career he had come to be more or less a cosmopolitan, with strong views on faggotry, which had its effect on me as well. In school, too, I found no reason to alter the picture of things I had formed at home. |Hitler}}

Today is the day that we begin the purge of Emo faggotry from the internuts. FOR THE FATHERLAND! We will burn their forums, rape their whores, plunder their chat rooms, and place their hair upon plates made of the teeth of infants! See the Targets section to learn what you should be doing.

=Tech Attacks=
==Targets==
* [[Emo Holocaust/targets|Full List]]

Right now, you must start stockpiling accounts on the top ten large sites, focusing most on the first few (especially emo-corner). Make sure to use names that sound legit, as 'mudkipz4chan' is fairly sure to get you kicked. Try and get about 20 accounts, maybe also spacing out the time between signups and using different proxies.

===Quick Targets===

These are sites that you can raid right this second. Mainly they are on free hosts. Have fun spamming and whatnot.

===Top Ten Large Sites===

These sites will be raided collectively, on September 11. Start psyopsing into them, stockpiling accounts, phishing, etc.

==Non DDoS / Hax==
===Vulnerabilities===
===Exploits===

emo-corner.com uses an IMAP server (see Portscan results below). the IMAP server is version "4-rev1". A known exploit is available, and can be found here.[1]

emo-corner.com's FTP server may be exploitable to gain root access. I cannot verify this as I cannot compile the code, a linux/Cygwin user should check it out. [2]

==Identifying an emo==

Should you need to take this IRL, here's a short field guide to identifying an emo.
An example.
An example.

#Hair: Over one or both eyes.
#Ears: Come with faggy earrings.
#Face: Femmy, with eyeliner and eyeshadow.
#Clothes: Band T-shirt or just some neon-colored tight T-shirt, and girl pants (no, really). 

==P3epe==

((((More dox coming! as soon as i can type them all pretty.!)))

P3epe is a fag that has taken it upon himself to stick up for all emos and alert every emo in the entire world of our wrong doings. He takes extra pride in himself and he likes lots of attention. He is not afraid of anonymous(or so he says lol). He is under the false impression that we cannot harm him in anyway that matters.. plan on making him think again.
*P3epe, if my memory serves me correctly, followed through with none of his proposed faggotry.

UK White Pages came up with this:

Haggarty R 0177 086 0493 Bruach, BRODICK, ISLE OF ARRAN, KA27 8ER

as the address for the only listed Haggarty in the Isle of Arran/Blackwaterfoot area. http://anonym.to/http://www.ukphoneinfo.com/cgi-bin-Phones/nng?GNG=0177+086+0493&Submit=Submit Gives the approximate location

Grid ref: NR9634 Latitude: 55° 33' N Longitude: 5° 14' W

Which matches up with the target location: http://anonym.to/http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&output=html&q=55%C2%B0+33%27+N+5%C2%B0+14%27+W&zoom=6
==Ruination==

* Main article: [[Ruination ]]

===Boxes===

* USPS BOX ORDER 

Just make an account with the address of your target (use a proxycondom) and order a shitload of stuff.

===Pizza Bombing===

===Free Korans/Books of Mormon===

Free Koran (US Only) - http://www.freekoran.com/form.php

Free Book of Mormon (They actually send missionaries to deliver the book. Worldwide.) - http://tinyurl.com/freemormon
===Prostitutes===

Go to Craigslist, click on the state where the target is, go to the Services section, and click "erotic." Find all the outcall escorts--that means that they come to you--and make an appointment for the target. Many escorts do not answer *67'd calls, so you might need a pay phone or Skype, but the lulz factor is tremendous. Best of all, instead of ordering a hooker for the kid, order one for the target's dad. She'll get there, and the wife will freak out, all hell breaks loose, and emo kid cuts himself some more. It's win-win.

    leads me to believe that this is in fact a home ip.
