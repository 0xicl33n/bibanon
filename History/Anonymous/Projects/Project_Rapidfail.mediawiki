= Project Rapidfail Redux =
'''Project Rapidfail''' is an ongoing phishing project for the /i/nsurgency w/i/ki. It is a user-ran give and take operation. The goal is to provide free accounts for many people and to continue to have our database grow at the same time.

== Tutorial ==
[[File:RapidfailPoster.png|thumb|right|Spread this shit]]
1. Download the new Rapidshare phish. http://anonym.to/?http://depositfiles.com/files/n4syuwt13<br>
2. Edit the Index.htm and the preim.htm so it displays any file name and size. (<nowiki>http://rapidshare.com/files/666666666/Cocks.rar | 666 KB</nowiki> are the default, if you can't handle a bit of [[HTML]] you can fuck yourself.)<br>
3. Register for free hosting at http://anonym.to/?http://66ip.com , http://anonym.to/?http://x10hosting.com/ or any other free web host. '''Protip: Use [[Tor]] when registering and uploading!'''<br>
4. Upload the phish site.<br>
5. Protect the "Rapidshare Link" with http://anonym.to/?http://lix.in/ or something similar.<br>
6. Make a convincing post on some warez site.<br>
7. Check for prem-log.txt on the server and grab the sweet fruit of internets.<br>
8. If you have '''extra''' accounts phished share them. (Account Repository. See it.)

== How it works? ==
It is very simple, all you need to do to continue to get rapidshare accounts is to contribute to the project. This can work in the form of three ways, management, templates, or posting. Posting is required to keep this project running.

Continue to spread the word to people and they will join the cause, tell them that active contributors will get accounts to use. Post on as many *chan boards that you can, let them in on this.

== Another method to generating Rapidshare accounts ==
This method worked for me to generate accounts and is fairly simple to take advantage of.

'''If you already have your own email domain (that isn't GMail, Yahoo, etc), start at step number 4.'''

1. Create a DynDNS address at .ath.cx or any other 'web director' that offers MX services. For this example, jewgolds.ath.cx.

2. Once your DynDNS .ath.cx/whatever is set up, sign up for Google Apps services for that domain.
''Please note that you'll need some way of getting Google to verify ownership of the "domain" you create, be it a quick hosted HTML file or otherwise. You'll need a way of hosting that file be it a quick Apache install on a home pc - just long enough for Google to see http://jewgolds.ath.cx/googlehosted.html or whatnot.''

3. Once you have verified your domain, activate GMail on the domain and set up the MX record with DynDNS. '''Test your email and make sure emails will go into your hosted GMail inbox.'''

4. Once GMail is working, register for a free demo account at [http://deviceanywhere.com Device Anywhere]. Bullshit info and when asked to select your device packages, select T-Mobile UK and Vodafone UK as well.
''Please note that you should do this on weekends or at late night when they do not verify your account. DA is known to disable accounts. When signing up you can only use your email domain ONCE.''

5. Wait for DeviceAnywhere to send you your temporary password, and log in. Download and install the DA client. Log into Device Anywhere.

6. Now, go to Rapidshare. Select the "create new Premium account" option, then the 1-month account. Select "PayByCall".

7. Tell PayByCall that you would like the UK access number. It should come up along with a PIN to enter when calling.

8. Now in the DA Studio, select one of the carriers from the drop-down box (ie "[UK] T-Mobile VDL"). Find a random device that is "Available". Right click on it and select "Acquire Device". If a box pops up asking to sign up for a standard account, just say 'no'.

9. Within a moment or so, the device will appear on your screen as if you were holding the phone in your hand. Right click on the phone and select "Enable Sound" from one of the menus.

10. With whatever phone, wake it up and dial your access number given by Rapidshare. If you've done everything right up to this point, you should hear "Enter your access PIN" from the Device Anywhere phone. Enter the PIN and wait.

11. While you hear the hold music on the phone, you'll see Rapidshare's Pay By Call window changing into a timer on how long to hold until you can hang up. Keep waiting. At the end your page will change and the phone will hang up. You should have your Rapidshare account login that you can now share with the community.

12. '''PROTIP''': Device Anywhere only gives you 3 hours of usage - and it counts down pretty fast (takes out 6 minutes even if you don't use it the full 6). '''Keep making accounts with it.'''

13. '''PROTIP''': You can also use free webmail domains from www.mail.com. Please make sure you post/edit into the wiki which domain you used, DA seems to remember these and think you're from the same company as the other guy getting free rapidshits.

== Account Repository ==
<strike>Put phished accounts on http://anonym.to/http://rapidfuck.pastebay.com/ with the password "Rapidfail".

DISREGARD THAT THE GUY WHO FUCKED WITH THE PASTEBAY SUCKS COCKS.

NEW PLAN: Find a site that will allow users to add a new account, not edit the entire fucking list.

New repo being made, fuck that pastebin bull shit...

 * Whipping up a php script to do just this, gimmie 10 or so minutes.
