==Trolling the Chinese Government==
'''
------------------------------------------
Watch closely for future guides and updates.
------------------------------------------
'''
*The objective is proving that China cannot control the 'net or information.
*DO NOT ACT until everyone is coordinated.
		
*The Team (Admins mostly. An heroes who will play scapegoat for faux news)
**Namefagging is dumb, all you 'originals' refer to the link in the irc topic.
Ask questions or give suggestions, but please, read the rest of the wiki first.

==tl;dr==
For those that are just in for teh lulz:
We're gonna fuck China up, first we're gonna spam a bunch of stuff to inform chinese ppl how much their government sucks on some of the most popular social networking sites... Then while we're doing that, we're gonna try DDoSing some of the important websites to Chinese technology (i.e. the Ministry of Technology)...

You seriously need to visit the IRC for more specific information, cause the target is watching this page and not much can be said here...

Reasons why you should do this:
*You're anon, and anon is legion.
*You're gonna be pissing off a world power, but as long as you don't live in China, what you're doing is perfectly legal...
*We might try fucking with the Great Fire Wall, because this whole thing started because Anon HATES censorship...
*For the lulz...

Things we're gonna try spamming:
*Tiananmen Square info, the government tries covering it up saying nothing happened... Read wikipedia
Read "What to post" above for more info...
Read "What NOT to post" above for more info...
Read "What to know before posting" above for more info...
There are also graphic guides showing you how to register on those chinese sites cause we can't read moonsymbols...

==Possible Plans==

===Master Plan===
# Concentrate on Tiananmen & other content that will convince government to hate us and people to love us-- specifically pictures or video
# One attack (Visit IRC to see dates)
# Multiple sites-- social networks & forums -- look at below plans
# For many moons 
# ???? -- Eat Ice cream?
# Profit!
# Eat ice cream!

===Plan A===
We will be occupying the Ministry of Technology with some shenanigans, in the mean time ... 
Here is our best bet, from end of Meeting #1: <br>
http://anonym.to/http://www.kaixin001.com <br>
It's like twitter, it is ranked 13th in China on alexa. Better than xiaonei because there are open groups which we can join and spam <br>
<br>
See below to see how to set up an account<br>
# Make account (only requires email)
# Join all open groups possible
# Spam anti government shit 
# ????
# Profit!

===Plan B===
# Go to http://anonym.to/http://xiaonei.com
# Register multiple accounts under the same name.  name is: [tbd]
# Add random friends, hard step 
# Post stuff, see below
# ????
# Profit!

===Plan C===
# Bot to spam Omegle

===Plan D===
# Bot to spam Chinese forums (need to find which forums first)
*There are lots of forums on Baidu Tieba (http://anonym.to/http://tieba.baidu.com/). It functions like 4chan, except there are thousands of different boards. Currently, posting new topics on all college/university's boards has been disabled. This is likely an attempt by the Chinese government to cover up Tiananmen Massacre's 20th anniversary. /b/ can start spamming right after the ban is lifted, and expose the truth to the group of people who the government fears the most.

===Tool to auto translate Chinese===
# Get firefox
# Greasemonkey: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748
# Translate script: http://anonym.to/http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/35187

This script works by simply highlighting the Chinese phrase, it will have a little box open up with the English translation, thought it might be more useful then copypasta google translate.

Someone should make it translate to Engrish for added lulz.

==What to know before posting==

Don't be a stupid Westerner. Some of the things Westerners criticize China for are right, and some of them are completely, utterly, ridiculously wrong. You're going to look like an idiot if you bring up one of the latter things.

===Tiananmen===

You should probably know what Tiananmen is. Tiananmen Square is a tourist attraction. It's a wide open area with tourist attractions on each of the four sides. On one of those sides is the Tiananmen itself. This is a gate with a picture of Mao on it, and some propaganda on both sides (to be exact, the propaganda reads "Long live the People's Republic of China" and "Long live world peace"). The protests happened on the square, not at the gate.

During the day, the square is usually ''packed'' with tourists (which is what makes it a decent protest site). Important government announcements, parades, etc generally happen here, and it's pretty heavily affiliated with government action (also what makes it a decent protest site). The point of all this is, if you mention "Tiananmen Square", people are going to think "tourist attraction" not "site of protest in the late 80s".

Many Chinese don't know that protests occurred at Tiananmen Square. This might just be because schools don't consider it important enough (Remember: something like half of America can't even find Iraq on a map). China has a long history - classes on Chinese history are going to be talking more about stuff that happened 4000 years ago than what happened now. Either way, it's pointless to criticize the Chinese for not knowing about the protests. Focus on what happened, not on why people don't know.

===Tibet===

Tibet isn't some poor little country that got invaded by Commies. It's been part of China for much of China's history, and although China left it alone for a while, they retook it during the reunification after the civil war. So you can think of China's taking back Tibet (and its intents to take back Taiwan, for that matter) as roughly analogous to Lincoln taking back the South.  

No, it is more analogous to the South defeating the North and demanding that the last stronghold of a legitimate government surrender itself.

Furthermore, the government didn't do all bad in Tibet. When the Commies retook it, they abolished slavery there, and many Tibetans supported the Commies. The Dalai Lama isn't exiled in the sense that he was forced out - he left of his own will, when his plans to overthrow the Commie government failed miserably.

===The Olympics===

Don't even ''think'' about mentioning the Olympics. It's a source of great national pride and accomplishment that China hosted the 2008 Olympics, and did a pretty good job in it. They're also proud of how well the Opening Ceremony expresses Chinese values, beliefs, etc.

And yes, they already know that the gymnasts were probably underage. It's not exactly the first time the government has lied. Hardly the worst thing the government's done. Focus on the human rights issues, guys. Ditto nitpicking anything else even vaguely related to the Olympics.

===Government corruption===

The Chinese know that their government is corrupt. They complain about it all the time, kind of like how Americans complain about pork-barrel spending, the war in Iraq, Guantanamo Bay, security theater, etc, etc. They're less open about it in public, because of the government, but consensus is that the government is pretty corrupt.

Just because there is consensus that the government is bad does not mean you can just attack them as outsiders. It's kind of like how you're probably not too satisfied with what Bush was doing, but if Middle Easterners are all like "DEATH TO AMERICA", you're probably going to be like "HELL NO." Make it clear that you're not attacking ''their country'', you're criticizing ''their government'' and ''their government's actions''.

===Government censorship===

People know that the government censors things, too. This is also one of the "hard not to notice" things. When talking about censorship of websites, people often use the euphemism "down for maintenance" - as in, "Hey, YouTube is down for maintenance again." "Oh, that's the government, hard at work maintaining websites for the 'benefit' of us comrades!"

Wikipedia and Google used to be blocked, but no longer are. YouTube is currently temporarily blocked. I don't know of any other high-profile sites that are blocked. Although Wikipedia is unblocked, certain articles, like "Tiananmen Square Incident of 1989" and "Democracy" are still blocked.

Getting a website blocked is pretty simple. I've gotten one of my own servers blocked for setting up a proxy to browse Wikipedia with it (this was when I was little, Wikipedia was blocked, and I had no idea how to encrypt a proxy).

===Other===

Some claims the following:

:Seasoned internet users and elites of Chinese internet know how the government censors things. But the ordinary masses don't; they just perceive it as temporary network outage. China has long history of censorship and its people are also adapted to it. But when the new freedom of internet was deprived, people became angry with the online representation of the government - the GFW. For Chinese internet users, what they usually feels is the internet blockage than real censorship in other media. The GFW is their primary perceived enemy rather than the government. 

:Great Firewall of China has been and is still keeping blocking and censoring every aspect of their internet life: Google, Wikipedia, Youtube, Twitter, Flickr, Plurk, ning, dozens of news sites, blogspot, my opera, wordpress blogs, also their own blogs. All these things for years have laid the anger and hatred foundation against the GFW among the most influential Chinese internet users. If we fuck the GFW, they'll join and make it bigger.

:''ordinary people'' in Chinese internet are already content with all kinds of network services in domestic internet, they do not need anything more outside China; when they are blocked, they just use the China-copy alternatives. Those ''active'' or ''elite'' users tend to use services outside China more and feel more anger when blocked.

I don't how much of this is true, but at least some of it's false. The last time I was in China (a few months ago), Google and Wikipedia were not blocked (Well, English Wikipedia - Chinese Wikipedia may have been blocked). The "ordinary masses" is ambiguous - peasants generally don't have Internet access, and don't know about censorship - but then again, peasants aren't censored at all - the government rarely visits them, and they're generally free to do anything they want (except move into cities, because of overpopulation issues). On the other hand, students living in cities (which are presumably our primary targets) are well aware of the censorship that goes on, and attitudes towards it is generally along the lines of dissatisfaction.

==What NOT to post==

* No English. Common Chinese people don't understand English. Just Chinese.
* No Olympics.
* No Tibet.
* No materials from your WESTERN MEDIA
::Chinese thinks in ways and viewpoints different from your westerner, they have different thoughts on concepts like human right or freedom of speech. The best materials we'll put should be from Chinese themselves.

== What to post ==
* Chinese. We shouldn't bring our own articles but rather, use those censored by China gov within China itself.
<!--
* Falungong is ok. ''Why?''  ('we should talk more about this.  There are disagreements about whether we should put falungong or not''
::We are about to troll the Chinese gov under the <strike>slogan of anti-censorship</strike>(show the slogan to Chinese to irritate their government, lulz for ourselves). Olympics and Tibet are complex topics that may cause nationalistic enthusiasm and make things worse. Falungong is anyway a domestic topic not involving any racial thing, good for trolling.　　
::What we should do is not to teach Chinese people about the "truth", but to fuck with the giant censorship system and show its incapability through massive posting of banned materials. Remeber, Tiananmen is a method not the purpose.-->
* Any kinds of stuff banned by China gov without nationalism involved, like:
** Tiananmen, usually called by Chinese as "June 4th" - don't just focus on Tiananmen, it's only a climax of series of incidents

<!--
** Young people in China do not even know about the Tiananmen Massacre because the government hides the information from them factual accounts of the massacre, like the number of people estimated killed, preferably from some government document.  When there's a coverup by something as big as a government, they tend to release one statement, and then a second that contradicts it.  If we could find that "first statement" where the government said "Lol we killed a few people", and then put that up against a "second statement" of "Nothing happened, forgetaboutit", we can juxtapose them and have some real credibility.  How can the government discredit its own statements?
* Some official third-party statement of facts about Chinese Goveernment human rights abuses.   Like something from some European government.  Something official enough that the Chinese Government can't just ignore it.-->
*Some ideas for short messages we can post along with the images:

**"Censorship is oppression: Tear down the Great Firewall."

**"Would YOU have the courage to do this?"

===Chinese text (translated into English)===

June 4th 1989, the Chinese government brutally murdered its own people to maintain its autocratic control. Thousands of defenseless students were massacred on Tiananmen Square. They were not violent dissidents, but students who only wanted a say to their governor. They fell, the people fell, left alone is the blood lusting violence.

We cannot only live for China's glory, we must live for its conscience and morality. We cannot live only for the future, we must live for history. What the past tells us are the agonizing cries of the people, our ancestors' resonating howls to awaken our morality. If we ignore the sacrifice of our heroes at Tiananmen, how are we to have any decency or honor?

China is not strong. Economic might is not sufficient for a country to be strong, its people must have morals as well. For a country that is afraid and ashamed to recognize its past, how could it be a giant? A government that suppresses its own people is afraid of its people. A government that is afraid of its own people, knows its illegitimacy. Until the day when the government is no longer afraid of the people, have the courage to face its mistake, and respectfully apologize to its people: Sorry, we were wrong. Until then, China can truly stand up.
