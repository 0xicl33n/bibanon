Voter fraud in Iran. Ahmadinejad is the purported winner who probably rigged the thing in the first place. The opposition candidate Mousavi has been placed under house arrest, political leaders in the Ahmadinejad's crew have called the election a sham, massive  riots broke out in Tehran despite police brutality. Reports have been coming in through Twatter on what's been going on, and the Iranian government is working overtime to do something about it including cutting internet access to the whole country and v&ing rogue twatters.

==Details==

There are some seriously epic fucking lulz to be had here. I think we know a thing or two about internet security, no?

<strike>See http://anonym.to/http://888chan.org/iran/res/94674.html</strike> http://888chan.org/iran/

==Raid==

===Primary Target: gerdab.ir hosting protestor images===

Iran's government is putting pictures of targeted protestors on the web for the Basij to identify and harass, arrest, or worse.
These individuals could be jailed, or worse, dead by tomorrow.  This website needs to die.


Note that if gerdab.ir goes down, all other sites (shahabnews and others) which link to their images won't function properly either.

====Slowloris====
# Load up [[SlowLoris]] on a Shell http://anonym.to/http://ha.ckers.org/slowloris/ 
# Point your loris at 81.12.13.144 a.k.a. gerdab.ir  (use -httpready and -timeout 500 for maximum effect)
# SLOWLORIS IS SLOW and [http://www.dogwork.com/superadorable/ MAXICUTE]
# ????
# PROFIT!
<br>
If you don't have linux, get the [http://www.remote-exploit.org/backtrack_download.html Backtrack LiveCD], faggots! <del>It won't work under wintendo.</del><br>
There is a [http://insurgen.info/wiki/SlowLoris windows version] of Slowloris, but windows is limited to open 130 sockets. It has yet to be confirmed if it's really effective, so I guess I should not have even put it here lawl. 


Here's another version of Slowloris: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyloris/
<br>
Usage:
<pre>python pyloris-1.7.py -l -r POST -s 500000 -g "/fa/pages/?cid=407" www.gerdab.ir</pre>
If you want to prevent the server from noticing you're using pyloris, you can pretend to be using, say, uh, Chrome on Windows, by adding:
<pre>
-u "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US) AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.31 Safari/530.5"
</pre>
<br>
gerdab.ir is currently up and responding a bit slow - need moar loris! KEEP FIRING!<br />  '''Do not try to bandwidth-DoS the gerdab.ir''' site, as it is physically in Iran and you might overload the country.  Slowloris or a syn-flood on port 25 is an option.<br>

For sites within Iran like gerdab.ir and shahabnews.com (links to protestor pics hosted on gerdab), use a tool like slowloris that consumes server threads, not bandwidth.  For gerdab.ir, use -httpready and -timeout 500.  For shahabnews.com, just -timeout 500.

====Mail Aids====

'''They appear to have taken down the form and are now requesting email to info@gerdab.ir.'''  Drowning them in noise is still a good tactic.
*If nothing else, sign up for every sketchy sweepstakes, porn site and diet plan with that email, and trust the spammers to pass it around.
*Do not try to bandwidth-DoS the site, as it is physically in Iran and you might overload the country.  A syn-flood on port 25 is an option.
<br>
'''PHP Script to automatically fill out forms to report immoral websites to gerdib.ir:<br>'''
*http://anonym.to/?http://trancy.net/iran/inf/pack.tgz (source - also includes some wordlists which other scripters might find useful)
*http://anonym.to/?http://www.yergez.com/foto/2008/08/08/index.php (use this if you don't want to install the script)
*Use this Firefox Addon to hide your referrer: http://anonym.to/?https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1999
<br>
'''Ruby Script to spam/DOS gerdib.ir SMTP Server:<br>'''
*http://anonym.to/?http://anonymous.pastebay.com/24007 (source)
*http://anonym.to/?http://github.com/sporkmonger/smtpwn/tree/master (better way of doing this)
<br>
'''NOTE:  '''Don't bother WOT-ing the site.  Iranians all fuck their camels anyway, so it's likely they don't give a shit about safe internets.


'''LOL MAILAIDS'''<br>
'''Probably the best option for lazy fags''' is to use an automatic mailbomber.
*http://anonym.to/?http://sidecode.net/?php=MailBomb  such a mailbomber that <del>wins</del> eats cocks hard. -tested on mailinator and no mails were sent!  Needs to be confirmed this is a working script!
**The password is "pvpguise"  witout the quotes.
**The limmit is 200 sends at one time, so send 200 emails over9000 times.   Also, change up the field information so that the spam filteres don't catch on.
*To further deceive the mail filters, use this random wordlist generator in order to fill out the body, sender, and subject fields with differing data:  http://anonym.to/?http://www.wordlistgenerator.net/

*  TARGET: http://anonym.to/http://www.information.is-the-coolest.com and http://anonym.to/http://www.r.ieves.com (59.167.214.254)
Someone is spamming those links on Twitter (http://twitter.com/rst325), pretending that it's anonymizers or breaking news. They're probably collecting IP's.<br>
PHP script to spam twitter (use from commandline) :
http://anonymous.pastebay.com/26292

*  TARGET: http://anonym.to/http://khodkar.ir - Very laggy but still up, need more lasers on this one. 

This gov-friendly news website is hosted in the Netherlands.

*  TARGET: http://anonym.to/https://smsmonitoring.itrc.ac.ir

This is one of the SMS monitoring computers for the IRTC. Find a way to take it down. Reported as open ports on 22/ssh and 443/https. There is a generic SSL certificate being used. Its running RHEL 5 on kernal 2.6.x.


*  TARGET:  <del>http://anonym.to/http://www.bultannews.com/pages/?cid=14164</del> got raepd.
A website located in Dallas, TX had pictures of supposed protesters/leaders and was asking for information leading to the arrests of said individuals.  Since the website was not located within Iranian borders, a resulting DDoS attack did nothing to lessen the information escaping Iran. <br />
May bultannews.com RIP.
<br>
*  TARGET: http://anonym.to/http://shahabnews.com/vdccxoqs.2bq0o8laa2.html#iranelections
Another website which links to the images from gerdab.ir

This fanclub is run by some Abbas A. Bhatti, likely this fag -> http://www.youtube.com/user/mukhtargi mukhtargi@hotmail.com
<br>
*  TARGET: filter@dci.ir - that's the email where Iranians can complain about blocked websites

* It's advised and completely acceptable to break into these sites and post pictures of the Ayatollah fucking a pig,  Mahmoud Amadinnerjacket being his queer self:[http://insurgen.info/wiki/File:GayMahmoud.jpg][http://insurgen.info/wiki/File:FagMahmoud.jpg].

* Post pictures of women in the act of triple or quadruple penetration if you don't feel like shopping those old pedophiles with barnyard animals.

* Shop faces of the Basijj onto protector faces or just replace the pictures with fakes.
