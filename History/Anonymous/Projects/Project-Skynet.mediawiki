=Introduction=
ACTA, the Anti Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, is an international treaty--being drafted mainly in secret--in order to stifle internet anonymity and freedom.  In the name of combating piracy, they are trading liberty for some security; they are seeking for increased surveillance and more strict copyright laws in order to protect the vast profits of those industries that rely on intellectual property

{{tinyquote|Her friend said it was o.k. to download the new movie. Yes, kids can be irresponsible and so can governments!  Proposed ACTA legislation will immediately invade your privacy and put your family at risk of onerous penalties or even jail time! A law brought to you by Sony, MGM and other large media companies. Should your privacy be a risk for a record company? We think there's a better way...|A look at the future}}

==How it can affect you==
* It increases the chances of getting your devices taken away: Portable media players that support free formats are less common than devices which support DRM, such as the iPod. Will this make them suspicious to border guards?
* It creates a culture of surveillance and suspicion, in which the freedom that is required to produce free software is seen as dangerous and threatening rather than creative, innovative, and exciting.
* Makes streaming or downloading a movie/game/music a FEDERAL crime and not a civil matter I.E No longer Accused vs Movie Corporation but U.S Government Vs Accused + Accused vs Movie Corporation in two separate trials.
* ISP will be fined if their customer had illegally downloaded copyrighted media, This will force ISP to monitor users

==Full ACTA text==
Following months of small Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement leaks, the [http://www.laquadrature.net/files/201001_acta.pdf full consolidated ACTA text]has now been posted online.  The consolidated text provides a clear indication of how the negotiations have altered earlier proposals as well as the first look at several other ACTA elements.  For example, last spring it was revealed that several countries had proposed including a de minimus provision to counter fears that the border measures chapter would lead to iPod searching border guards.  The leak shows there are four proposals on the table.

On the bright side, there are those who stand on the side of internet freedom, net neutrality, and fair, reasonable copyright laws -- and, consequentially, they are none too fond of ACTA.
