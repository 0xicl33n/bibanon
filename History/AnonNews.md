[AnonNews](http://anonnews.org) was the primary website reporting on Anonymous activities, and was the place where many operations during the Payback era was made. It was once the hubsite for Anonymous and the media, and now it's just a broken shell.

It's been in a pretty horrid state right now, so we need to save the whole thing before it goes down for good.
