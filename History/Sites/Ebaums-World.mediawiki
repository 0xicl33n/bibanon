Cause of all raids, the home of [[Anonymous]], and an Internet Hate Machine operated by hackers on steroids.
==Know Your Enemy==

===Origins===
eBaums World started out in 2000 under the name "e-Bombs" as a subdomain of it's parent site SomethingAwful.com which was, at the time, a semi-public forum created as an underground hacker website with six boards, each assigned to their specific purpose: 


MapRoom, a board dedicated to planning attacks based on "strength in numbers" or "simple but effective" tactics,


SigInt, a board dedicated to planning attacks on unmonitored channels in IRC chatrooms and/or planning attacks that require skilled "/i/ndividuals" to perform,


Academy of Arts (before being renamed Dojo of the Thundercod), a board dedicated to teaching "newfags" on how become a member, this boards is separated into 3 sections: "1nd" semester; Our Ways (The rules), "2rd" semester; Bullshido, "3st" semester; Children of Boredom,


E-Bombs (aka "teh armory"), a board dedicated to distributing malicious programs and hacking tools,


Media, an offtopic board with four sub-boards: Music, Video Games, Television, Internet,


As Something Awful grew popular, Media and E-Bombs easily became the most popular boards since Media was accesible to anyone without needing to spend time in the academy and E-Bombs because using tools to hack was far easier for inexperienced hackers and didn't require them to finish the 'Bullshido' phase of the academy.

===Death and Resurrection===
In late 2001 Something Awful was threatened by lawsuits and lost numerous cases, as a result the owner, Richard Charles Kyanka, scrapped every board except Media and made Something Awful into a forum about "funny stuff on teh internets",

However, e-bombs wasn't gone for long since many "/i/nsurgents" protested against the site reform and shortly after, decided to recreate e-Bombs under the guise of "eBaum's World" a rather friendly name, at first glance this may look like an ordinary site with a lot of funny stuff and childish mischief, along with a few traces of pornography, but in fact, it actually houses that very same (though, more modern) e-bombs board which is password protected and hidden away from clueless visitors.

===Notorious eBaums Stunts===
* Hacking the Epilepsy Foundation.
* Harassing with Hal Turner and Tom Green.
* Hijacking Governor Sarah Palin's e-mail address and sending fake pornography of her to their friends and also government officials FROM that email address.
* Tricking Fox News into thinking 4chan did it.
* Inventing Rick Rolls.
* Threatening to destroy a football stadium with a yellow van.
* Spreading pornographic videos on YouTube.
* Hacking YouTube.
* Bringing Tay Zonday to e-fame.
* Stealing seven different passwords from the same man.

===eBaums vs the internets===
eBaums takes pleasure in vandalizing articles on Encyclopedia Dramatica (a satirical wiki much like Uncyclopedia) and the /i/nsurgency w/i/ki to make it seem like the 4chan is responsible for the attacks.
==Respectable news source, Fox News, on <strike>4chan</strike> eBaums!==
Respectable, American, right winged (right winged = American, and good) news source, has done a report on eBaums World. .

This video is correct. They even highlight eBaum's slogan "Destroy, die, attack".

==How You Can Protect Yourself==
*Buy a dog.
*Install a phone tracing system.
*Get yourself a better rooter.
*Seek Scientology for help.
*Ask the 4chan for help in securing your identity online, and protecting you against eBaums.

===Accessing the Secret e-Bombs forum===
Not that you would ever want to such a place but if you are brave enough to join our cause then follow these steps ''carefully'':
* Go to eBaums.
* Create an account.
* Search for the most recent "Friday Unearthly Cleavage Knockout" (aka F.U.C.K. eBaums enjoys subtlety and symbolism) and post a comment on the 9th image saying this: "Mors Principium Est" without the colons BUT DON'T POST THE COMMENT YET!
* Now this is the tricky part, you see, the password rotates, in other words, it gets changed every time a new "F.U.C.K." get's released, the last known password was "tartarus" as of February 2010, but don't lose hope yet!
* There is another way, go to Farout Asian Pictorial (F.A.P., Oh how they mock us) and in the comments box of the 5th image and in the first line type in "5/19/13" without the colons, then type in the password "some" AND the second last word in the pages source code, which should be "</body>" without punctuation, so in other words, the password is "somebody", type the password on the second line.

Once inside take screenshots and send them to your local police bureau.
