## 4chan history

4chan's history is to be divided into concurrent periods, like that of Japanese history. Each era was dominated by different immigrant groups from other websites, who imported the funniest memes of their culture into the melting pot of /b/.

_Below is a small plan of what You're free to change this as needed_

### Pre Anonymous

* Prehistory (1996-2003) - The background of the world that 4chan was started in.
* Genesis (2003-2004) - 4chan becomes wildly popular as a new home for Something Awful's ADTRW refugees, who in turn spread word across the internet. This era maintains a strong influence by that of ADTRW and 2chan.
* Mootxico Era (2004-2005) - 4chan gets well known for anonymity and crazy porn, and gains a culture of absolute hatred and trolling. Some of the original users begin to thin out as they lose interest, but are just as quickly replaced by users going between SA and 4chan. 4chan becomes a fast changing society beginning to carve out it's own culture and place in the world.
* Civil War Era (2005-2006) - During the Civil War Era, the 4chan community gets it's first experience with internet warfare in the coalition attack against [[Ebaums World]], and later [[Haboo Hotel]]. Raids become commonplace on /b/ for the first time. School shooting plans and stadium bombings are posted. 4chan's nominal anonymity begins to attract a bunch of colorful groups to 4chan, such as [[Touhou]] fans, guro lovers, pedophiles, and worst of all, [[Furries]]. Most of these groups are given their own boards to keep them out of the other ones, but curiously, Furries have not. A persecution complex causes them to react badly to criticism, and minor distaste evolves into total hatred that threatens to destroy the boards. When the 4chan mods begin to ban all anti-furry talk along with the imposition of a few tighter rules, a number of /b/tards leave 4chan for dead and abandon en masse. A declaration of independence is made that establishes [[Anonymous]] as a seperate group with it's home anywhere but 4chan.
  * Raids of this period: [[Habbo Raids]]
* Golden Age (2006-2008) - Ironically, while preaching the death of 4chan, the diaspora only managed to burn it further into internet culture. Returning SA members take the chanese tradition of Caturday back home, which eventually goes viral as Lolcats. 4chan trolls spread across the internet to cause more rage. Newfags come in expecting a hacker playground, and after the Fox News report on Anonymous, 4chan's /b/ eventually regains a strong raid mentality that the mods have given up stopping. After two years of media hype, 4chan is flooded with immigrants from all parts of the internet, creating a larger ratio of quality content to crap content. This ratio has stayed constant, but the greater amount of crap misleads older users to believe that a cancer has overcome /b/.
  * Works of this period: [[Damaged Goods]], [[Blindmute Loli]], most of [[Wikichan]] [[copypasta]]
  * Raids of this period: [[Hal Turner]], etc
  * Projects of this period: [[Wikichan]], [[LURKMOAR Wiki]], Chanese Colonization of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]

### Post Anonymous

* Chanology Era (2008-2009) - Project Chanology took center stage during this period, although it eventually divested itself of 4chan.
* Boxxy Era (2009-2010) - A period where [[Boxxy]], a young [[Gaia Online]] user, found herself as the primary target of similitaneous adoration and hate from /b/tards on 4chan. 
* Payback Era (2010-) - _shouldn't this be part of [[Anonymous]] history?_ After most anons forgot or gave up on Chanology, they returned to normal business on 4chan, which was still slowly growing in popularity. However, with the chilling news that Aiplex Software was DDoSing torrent sites for the MPAA, [[Anonymous]] came right out of dormancy to start a new age of hacktivism that grew to [[Wikileaks]], the [[Arab Spring]], and 

## Prehistory

_Most of this comes from a tertiary source, a Redditor who restored the [[4chan History Timeline]] to the second [[Wikichan]]. Please correct any problems you see._

4chan may have been the most successful English anonymous discussion board, but it was neither the first nor the most popular.

Strong parallels to [[4chan]], [[7chan]], and [[Anonymous]] can be identified in [[Ayashii World]], [[2channel]], and Nanashi World.

### Ayashii World

Full Article: [[Ayashii World]]

In 1996, a man named Masayuki Shiba creates an anonymous BBS called [[Ayashii World]] (Strange/Suspicious World). Here, Warez and cp are commonly posted, and there is a gesu (scum) board where website hackings and invasions are discussed.

Inspired by it's revolutionary approach, many similar BBSes are formed, collectively called Nanashi Warudo (Nameless World). Like 4chan, these sites develop a culture based on memes, which became popular a while later. Ayashii World functioned as the hubsite of Nanashi World in a similar way to 4chan and Anonymous.

Ayashii World never had good servers, and shutdowns were commonplace for various reasons. After Masayuki Shiba received personal threats over the server issues, in 1998 he shut the site down for the last time.

### 2channel (2ch.net)

Nanashi World moved off to [[Amezou]], the First Channel. At the time, it was merely a bunch of links to alternative BBSes, but soon becomes its own forum and introduces a new style of threaded message board, dependent on bumping and saging.

With a userbase larger than that of most cities, the First Channel was dead by 1999. An American college student named Hiroyuki Nishimura took up the challenge and created [[2channel]], the Second Channel. Using code based on the first, the site employed Californian high-traffic servers to handle the exponential growth.

2channel ended up becoming the longest running This was the text-based BBS featured in the film and TV series [[Densha Otoko]].

### Futaba Channel (2chan.net)

Full Article: [[Futaba Channel]]

By April 2001, [[2channel]] began to fall apart as data transformation bugs threatened to render the entire website unusable. Users began to warn of the coming apocalypse while volunteers from across Japan worked to find a solution.  

Just like before, multiple backup forums were created to house the refugees. Most were blatant copies of the textboard format, but one website called [[Futaba Channel]] (2chan.net) took it as a chance to experiment with a revolutionary idea: the Imageboard. 

With the textboards of the past, only experienced artists were able to make complicated Shift-JIS art, with images only linked. Now, any random lurker could simply download an image and post it as the topic of discussion. Anonymity combined with imageboards always leads to The site developed a unique culture all its own, growing out of the seeds brought by the 2channelers.

### world2ch

Full Article: [[world2ch]]

One of the backup forums made during the 2001 [[2channel]] crisis was called world2ch. This time, it's webmaster Taichirou Kosugi had a more ambitious goal: to create an English-language textboard where Japanese and American otakus could come together to speak in horribly broken English.

While the project became well-known on [[2channel]] itself, the anonymous textboard format never really appealed to Westerners, due to the general preference of vanity over content on conventional forums. Additionally westerners were used to the accounts and one-click smileys of conventional forums. Few saw the point of making time-consuming Shift-JIS art that was unable to viewed with the common ASCII encoding.

Still, the board was a groundbreaking first in the export of the 2channel-style anonymous BBS. Many later influential names started out or at least passed by this site, such as [[Shii]] and [[Moot]]. World2ch also took initiative to create the first English-language Imageboard.

But by 2006, World2ch ended merely as another failed copy of 2channel, with it's owner leaving the community for dead.

> I make a hobby and occasionally a living by being a digital archaeologist. [...] This whole 2ch business is more of digital anthropology. It's like I was wandering in some jungle of network cabling and there in the middle of it found a strange and totally alien tribe whose culture I can't begin to comprehend. That's why I'm here. Well, actually, here is more like the tourist version of 2ch. It's like a tacky roadside attraction complete with aluminum teepees where those passing through can just sort of fake living in the culture they've only seen at a distanceâ€¦ 

### Something Awful

Full Article: [[Something Awful]]

On the other side of the world, a conventional English forum called Something Awful (SA) was at it's greatest height. SA was the 4chan of it's day, presiding over a massive community who were mostly free to discuss the stranger stuff on the internet. It was also a major source of Internet culture in the early '00s, popularizing such lasting influences like the image macro, Numa Numa, and All Your Base (are belong to us).

We can sum it all up with their slogan; "The internet makes you stupid."

Some time between 18th April 2001 and 15th May 2001, SA added an anime board called [[ADTRW]] to separate the anime chat from the other boards. This forum quickly become connected to [[2channel]] and [[Futaba Channel]], and absorbed some parts of their culture.

Lowtax's later attempts to clean up the board, enforce heavy handed laws, and monetize the site causes a mass migration from the site. A few members of ADTRW started [[Raspberry Heaven]], an IRC channel that serves as the community maintained home of the ADTRW diaspora. 

## Raspberry Heaven

[[Raspberry Heaven]], a DC++ filesharing hub for anime, named for the ending theme to a 2002 series called Azumanga Daioh. Raspberry Heaven was itself a spinoff of SADCHUB, the Something Awful Direct Connect Hub, created to separate the anime from the serious business.

The Raspberry Heaven anime hub had a linked IRC channel, originally at the MircX network but later Pyoko IRC. Here, [[moot]] and several ADTRW
members were regulars. RH discovered [[Futaba Channel]] (2chan.net), a Japanese image board, and for a while the channel was full of 2chan image links. 2chan itself was conceived as a replacement for 2channel (2ch.net). This was the now unrelated text-based BBS featured in the film and TV series [[Densha Otoko]].

Sooner or later, Raspberry Heaven discovered [[Futaba Channel]] (2chan.net), a Japanese image board, and for a while the channel was full of 2chan image links.

## Genesis

*Originally written on [Jonathan's Reference Pages](http://www.jonnydigital.com/).*

4chan was founded in 2003 by a kid from an IRC channel I visited at the time. It got popular purely by accident and when costs began to spiral
out of control we told him the site was doomed to failure. If I had known it one day become a dominant source of Internet culture with five
hundred million pageviews per month and an [Alexa Traffic Rank](http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/4chan.org) in the global top 1,000
websites, I might have written more of this down at the time.

4chan's original culture really goes back to a board called [[Something Awful]] (SA), a major source of Internet culture in the early '00s. Some time between 18th April 2001 and 15th May 2001, SA added an anime board called [[ADTRW]] to separate the anime chat from the other boards. Members of ADTRW started [[Raspberry Heaven]], a DC++ filesharing hub for anime, named for the ending theme to a 2002 series called Azumanga Daioh. Raspberry Heaven was itself a spinoff of SADCHUB, the Something Awful Direct Connect Hub, created to separate the anime from the serious business.

The Raspberry Heaven anime hub had a linked IRC channel, originally at the MircX network but later Pyoko IRC. Here, moot and several ADTRW
members were regulars. RH discovered [[Futaba Channel]] (2chan.net), a Japanese image board, and for a while the channel was full of 2chan image links. 2chan itself was conceived as a replacement for 2channel (2ch.net). This was the now unrelated text-based BBS featured in the film and TV series [[Densha Otoko]].

Sooner or later, Raspberry Heaven discovered [[Futaba Channel]] (2chan.net), a Japanese image board, and for a while the channel was full of 2chan image links.

At some point, 2chan blocked non-Japanese from posting. At the time we thought this was to keep out us English-posting gaijin devils, but I
think it later turned out they were blocking trolls from South Korea. [[moot]], at this point just an average hub member on Raspberry Heaven, registered the site's original domain, 4chan.net.

    <Lost_Technology> Did someone seriously register 4chan?

According to [Everything Shii Knows](http://shii.org/knows/4chan), moot registered 4chan.net on 29th September 2003. The first [news
post](http://www.4chan.org/news/?all) dates the site as opening two days later on 1st October. 

The foundation of 4chan fired up much of the English anonymous forum community, especially in [[world2ch]]. The archived thread [[here|dramabomb.txt]] gives a rare look into what was happening at the time.

RH went from full of 2chan links to full of 4chan
links. I remember pasting links in other channels, too. The ease of which a person could post content and share links like this was a major
factor in the success of 4chan, and other top websites later replicated this model: Youtube (video), Imageshack (long-term image storage), and
Rapidshare (files).

4chan drew many of its initial users from Raspberry Heaven and Something Awful's ADTRW board. Early 4chan thus inherited a lot of the Something
Awful humour and memes, like image macros. The original 4chan staff and moderators were drawn from ADTRW. The spinning head title image is an
Australian ADTRW member called Roobar. The "Dot net fo'shizzle!" title image is by ADTRW poster Rick\_Feynman, who coined the term "ZOMG!" (we
pronounce it "Zoh my god!") in an ICQ conversation with fellow SA goon Hannibal (see also this [2003 USENET
posting](http://groups.google.com/group/alt.sports.basketball.nba.boston-celtics/msg/b1c35ce7823fa799?pli=1));
although they admit the term was used before then, it wasn't widely used until popularized by Something Awful and 4chan.

moot later left Raspberry Heaven, as he was cool for us. Raspberry Heaven DC hub would close some years later as BitTorrent took over from
filesharing hubs and Pyoko IRC closed its doors.
