## 4chan history

4chan's history is to be divided into concurrent periods, like that of Japanese history. Each era was dominated by different immigrant groups from other websites, who imported parts of their

## Prehistory

_Most of this comes from a secondhand source, the [[4chan History Timeline]]. Please correct any problems you see._

4chan may have been the most successful English anonymous discussion board, but it was neither the first nor the most popular.

Strong parallels to [[4chan]], [[7chan]], and [[Anonymous]] can be identified in [[Ayashii World]], [[2channel]], and Nanashi World.

### Ayashii World

Full Article: [[Ayashii World]]

In 1996, a man named Masayuki Shiba creates an anonymous BBS called [[Ayashii World]] (Strange/Suspicious World). Here, Warez and cp are commonly posted, and there is a gesu (scum) board where website hackings and invasions are discussed.

Inspired by it's revolutionary approach, many similar BBSes are formed, collectively called Nanashi Warudo (Nameless World). Like 4chan, these sites develop a culture based on memes, which became popular a while later. Ayashii World functioned as the hubsite of Nanashi World in a similar way to 4chan and Anonymous.

Ayashii World never had good servers, and shutdowns were commonplace for various reasons. After Masayuki Shiba received personal threats over the server issues, in 1998 he shut the site down for the last time.

### 2channel (2ch.net)

Full Article: [[2channel]]

Nanashi World moved off to [[Amezou]], the First Channel. At the time, it was merely a bunch of links to alternative BBSes, but soon becomes its own forum and introduces a new style of threaded message board, dependent on bumping and saging.

With a userbase larger than that of most cities, the First Channel was dead by 1999. An American college student named Hiroyuki Nishimura took up the challenge and created [[2channel]], the Second Channel. Using code based on the first, the site employed Californian high-traffic servers to handle the exponential growth.

2channel ended up becoming the longest running This was the text-based BBS featured in the film and TV series [[Densha Otoko]].

### Futaba Channel (2chan.net)

By April 2001, [[2channel]] began to fall apart as data transformation bugs threatened to render the entire website unusable. Users began to warn of the coming apocalypse while volunteers from across Japan worked to find a solution.  

Just like before, multiple backup forums were created to house the refugees. Most were blatant copies of the textboard format, but one website called Futaba Channel (2chan.net) took it as a chance to experiment with a revolutionary idea: the Imageboard. 

With the textboards of the past, only experienced artists were able to make complicated Shift-JIS art. Now, with the power of images, anyone could post advanced content, perhaps as a topic of discussion.  The site developed a unique culture all its own, growing out of the seed culture brought by the 2channelers.

 discovered [[Futaba Channel]] (2chan.net), a Japanese image board, and for a while the channel was full of 2chan image links. 2chan itself was conceived as a replacement for 2channel (2ch.net). 

## Genesis

*Originally written on [Jonathan's Reference Pages](http://www.jonnydigital.com/).*

4chan was founded in 2003 by a kid from an IRC channel I visited at the time. It got popular purely by accident and when costs began to spiral
out of control we told him the site was doomed to failure. If I had known it one day become a dominant source of Internet culture with five
hundred million pageviews per month and an [Alexa Traffic Rank](http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/4chan.org) in the global top 1,000
websites, I might have written more of this down at the time.

4chan's original culture really goes back to a board called [[Something Awful]] (SA), a major source of Internet culture in the early '00s. Some time between 18th April 2001 and 15th May 2001, SA added an anime board called [[ADTRW]] to separate the anime chat from the other boards. Members of ADTRW started [[Raspberry Heaven]], a DC++ filesharing hub for anime, named for the ending theme to a 2002 series called Azumanga Daioh. Raspberry Heaven was itself a spinoff of SADCHUB, the Something Awful Direct Connect Hub, created to separate the anime from the serious business.

The Raspberry Heaven anime hub had a linked IRC channel, originally at the MircX network but later Pyoko IRC. Here, moot and several ADTRW
members were regulars. RH discovered [[Futaba Channel]] (2chan.net), a Japanese image board, and for a while the channel was full of 2chan image links. 2chan itself was conceived as a replacement for 2channel (2ch.net). This was the now unrelated text-based BBS featured in the film and TV series [[Densha Otoko]].

At some point, 2chan blocked non-Japanese from posting. At the time we thought this was to keep out us English-posting gaijin devils, but I
think it later turned out they were blocking trolls from South Korea. moot, at this point just an average hub member, registered the site's
original domain, 4chan.net.

    <Lost_Technology> Did someone seriously register 4chan?

According to [Everything Shii Knows](http://shii.org/knows/4chan), moot registered 4chan.net on 29th September 2003. The first [news
post](http://www.4chan.org/news/?all) dates the site as opening two days later on 1st October. RH went from full of 2chan links to full of 4chan
links. I remember pasting links in other channels, too. The ease of which a person could post content and share links like this was a major
factor in the success of 4chan, and other top websites later replicated this model: Youtube (video), Imageshack (long-term image storage), and
Rapidshare (files).

4chan drew many of its initial users from Raspberry Heaven and Something Awful's ADTRW board. Early 4chan thus inherited a lot of the Something
Awful humour and memes, like image macros. The original 4chan staff and moderators were drawn from ADTRW. The spinning head title image is an
Australian ADTRW member called Roobar. The "Dot net fo'shizzle!" title image is by ADTRW poster Rick\_Feynman, who coined the term "ZOMG!" (we
pronounce it "Zoh my god!") in an ICQ conversation with fellow SA goon Hannibal (see also this [2003 USENET
posting](http://groups.google.com/group/alt.sports.basketball.nba.boston-celtics/msg/b1c35ce7823fa799?pli=1));
although they admit the term was used before then, it wasn't widely used until popularized by Something Awful and 4chan.

moot later left Raspberry Heaven, as he was cool for us. Raspberry Heaven DC hub would close some years later as BitTorrent took over from
filesharing hubs and Pyoko IRC closed its doors.
