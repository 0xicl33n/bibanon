This site was one of the primary wikis used by Anonymous to inform or call for raids outside of 4chan. It was a major component in the Partyvan network.

Due to it's up and down status, it's ownership of one of the few records of Anonymous's raids, and the importance of the unorganized pages within, we've saved it here and implemented them into our [[Books]] and [[History]] articles.

The last surviving incarnation of the Partyvan Wiki. This site is where we got most of the pages from.
