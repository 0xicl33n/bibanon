Gamespot has put up a poll for underage fags to vote for the "Greatest Hero Video Game Hero of All Time". It is obvious from the poll that these fags have no sense of good gaming whatsoever. It's also true that the only reason Gamespot is doing this is for the jew golds.
Some of the greatest video game characters of all time have lost to some neo-age faggy people. Phoenix Wright, Bomberman, Dig Dug, Fox McCloud, Little Mac, and many other epic heroes have lost to faggots. 

But not all hope is lost, when Anon saw this faggotry go down, we knew there would be much lulz and butthurt to be had. Gamespot obviously paired the two epic fucking dragons that blow bubbles at you, Bub & Bob, against the faggy Master Chief from ZOMGHALO. Obviously MicroShaft payed Gamespot to have Master Chief paired against someone who they thought would lose. They were wrong.

With our forces combined, we voted in epic numbers for Bub & Bob, winning the first two rounds, defeating Master Chief and Sonic. After winning the third round against Samus Aran, Gayspot switched the votes to make Samus the winner.

Link got beaten, at least there is some justice.

<center><font color="red">GAMESPOT HAS SWITCHED THE VOTES SO [http://www.gamespot.com/greatest-video-game-hero/vote/index.html?battle_id=53 SAMUS WON]</font>
Gamespot has switched the votes so that samus WON. Bub & Bob had 53.1% and Samus had 46.9% when the count down ended. I can confirm that Bub & Bob said "WINNER! Moves on to the next round". About 5 minutes later, the Final Results switched, making Bub & Bob have 46.9% and Samus have 53.1% (and winning)

I came home eager to get online. Why? Because the gamespot greatest game hero vote round 3 was set to end in 30 minutes.

I hopped on, went to the polls, and saw two of my favorite game characters of all time, Bub & Bob, were in the lead. They had 53.1% to be exact. Their rival, Samus Aran, had 46.9%. I also saw that Gordon Freeman was winning. Both of these things made me happy.

30 minutes later the countdown ended, and I refreshed the page, to see the golden label "WINNER! Moves on to the next round" on Bub & Bob's Pic, as well as on Gordon Freemans. I was very happy, and couldn't wait for the next round.

Then about 10 minutes later someone in a chatroom said that samus won. I of course replyed to him saying that Bub & Bob won.
Then I went to the poll page. I saw samus has 53.1% and Bub & Bob had 46.9%. Samus was declared the winner.

Gamespot has unfairly switched the votes for these two contestants. Why?. There was no recount, just switched the votes.
The votes that we have fairly earned. I admit, we used proxys to vote for Bub & Bob, but I can confirm that so did the people who voted for Samus. Another forum of sorts decided it would be funny to mass vote for samus.
If gamespot was to do a FAIR recount, I am positive that they will find Bub & Bob won fair and square. I have seen countless proxys that have voted for samus.

Do what you will gamespot, but hear me: Make the wrong move, and you will undoubtedly face severe consequences.

We are.... here.

Note: pretty much as soon as i posted this i got banned for "clear insult to users". Obviously mods can't read for shit.

==Game Plan==
<s>Outlook for Bub & Bob is pretty good atm, and we should beable to beat samus. After that we will most likely face megaman, who should be fairly easy. But thats when we run into a problem. It's almost certain we will face Mario in the semi-finals, and It's almost certain we will lose. So, In the next round (when Bub & Bob are facing megaman) we need to make sure mario loses. It will be hard, but should be easier than if Mario faces Bub & Bob. Think about it: We are basically the only ones voting for Bub & Bob. At the time of writing, Kratos (who will probably be facing mario) has 45K votes. Most of these are legit. If we vote for both Bub & Bob and Kratos in the next round, In theory we should beable to almost double Kratos's votes, and hopefully defeating mario (who is basically the final boss; he has the most votes out of anyone). then in the semi-finals we will go against Kratos instead of mario, giving us a chance at winning. 
And Plus if mario loses it will cause massive butthurt to everyone.
After defeating Mario, B&B will be in the finals (most probably against Link, but that's tl;dr). This is when we'll have to get srs, as all GSfags who haven't quit will be on our tails, and will massvote against whoever is against B&B.

It'll be a difficult battle, but if we win, we basically fucked over all of GameSpot.

=== Contingency Plan ===
</s>[[File:Samusfucker.jpg|300px|thumb|right|alt| Gamespot switched votes!]]
<s>If we lose and/or when this is all over we will launch an attack on Gamespot. Specifically render their site useless, among other standard website raiding tactics. Ultimately though don't forget that gayspot is the real final final boss. They have been the faggots that has won and benefited greatly from this hits and publicity stunt. They will go down sooner or later.</s>

Increase all trolling techniques.

== Forum Posts for Trolling ==

Here's a link to the Bungie forum post with a lot of the victory quotes.
http://anonym.to/?http://www.bungie.net/Forums/posts.aspx?postID=36686021
It's incredibly easy to troll them.

And a link to a Gamespot forum post. http://anonym.to/?http://www.gamespot.com/pages/forums/show_msgs.php?topic_id=27030032&tag=topics;title Not as lulzy to troll as Bungiefag forums but still worth it.

== Victories ==
Bub & Bob have been declared the official winners of the voting. We will have to fend off the next voting frenzy for their next opponent when it approaches.

Retards over at the bungie forums and gamespot forums are in a massive rage.
