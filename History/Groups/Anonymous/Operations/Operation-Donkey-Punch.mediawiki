There are a number of us over at the whyweprotest forums and anonnet preparing for a major strike against Miscavige for 09/19, most of the op is treehaus and thus will not be discussed here. We have a good number of IRL cells preparing for something... interesting.

We want to time as many potential anon actions on one day as possible, we want to fucking raid again for realz yo. We intend to spread the word about DM's beatings and his inability to sue anybody over the allegations as far and wide as inhumanly possible.

There is some confusion over what the general idea behind what 'Donkey Punch' is. I'll explain it to you people. See, a donkey punch is when you're fuckin a bitch up the ass and you're likin it real good see....  but there's something missing. In the moment, you're like, fuck d00d, I've been here before. Nothing new. So you punch the bitch in the back of the kneck all SURPRISE! And she tenses up see, that ass muscle. That's what we're doing to miscavige. 

What we're doing is simple: rape, /i/nvade, /m/indfuck.

Step 3: Choose a time for the online raid<br>
Step 4: Deploy trolls<br>
Step 5: ????<br>
Step 6: CULT WIDE CHAOS AND CONFUSION<br>

==TO DO==

'''OL RAID:''' 
-Proposed Targets:<br> 
Failbook, twitter, craigslist, j00tube
-Looking for a volunteers to run a radio station and streams the night of the raid. <br>
-Anyone interested in making a video for this operation?<br>
-finalize time for OL raid: should we go for before or after the IRL raid?<br>
-LOOKS LIKE THERE'S STILL ALOT OF NIGGERS BEIN FRAID TO PUT THEIR PLANS UP HERE.
-http://www.installerapps.com/2009/09/04/anonymous/ : with this itouch app, you can change the sender's email to whatever you like ie: xenu@marcab.net and resend as many as you want without re writing.

'''Skype/Phone/Fax Raid'''<br>
The idea is, rather than your standard 'harassing phone calls' that are 'illegal', for this operation we call them 'informative outreach actions'. Plain and simple, the information in SP times articles about David Miscavige is known to fuck up the day of many a scilon when he reads it unfiltered and sees the names of the accusers. Some brave anons have volunteered to give up their coveted pokemons so we can have some new numbers to call.

While of course we'll be calling/faxing the normal publicly listed numbers, on the night of the raid, /i/nsurgents will be provided with new intel so that they might make contact with public scilons in the comfort of their own home. 

'''IRL RAID:''' See above quotes, 

-We need materials to give out for the raid, please post in the fleet command thread (link blow) and it will be linked to in the main post. <br>
-Come up with something lulzy for the 19th.<br>
-Spread the word.<br>
-This is handy for the 'Dianetics raid': http://marcab.ning.com/group/flyersandgraphics/forum/topics/who-is-david-miscavige-full and this: http://marcab.ning.com/group/flyersandgraphics/forum/topics/who-is-david-miscavige-full-1
''-If you are planning an IRL raid and aren't 'in on it'...  fuckin PM someone in one of the places willya?'' <br>
