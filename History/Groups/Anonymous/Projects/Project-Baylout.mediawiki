The founders of The Pirate Bay were arrested. TPB itself, however, will remain up and usable, so nothing to worry about. People are still, however, extremely pissed, and the RIAA and MPAA are still going to be violently raped.

==What happened==
Fredrik Neij, Gottfrid Svartholm Warg, Carl Lundström and Peter Sunde were found guilty of breaking copyright law and were sentenced to a year in jail.
They were also ordered to pay $4.5m (£3m) in damages.
Record companies welcomed the verdict but the men are to appeal and Sunde said they would refuse to pay the fine.
Speaking at an online press conference, he described the verdict as "bizarre".
"It's serious to actually be found guilty and get jail time. It's really serious. And that's a bit weird," Sunde said.
"It's so bizarre that we were convicted at all and it's even more bizarre that we were [convicted] as a team. The court said we were organized. I can't get Gottfrid out of bed in the morning. If you're going to convict us, convict us of disorganize crime.
"We can't pay and we wouldn't pay. Even if I had the money I would rather burn everything I owned, and I wouldn't even give them the ashes."
	
It is almost certain that The Pirate Bay will keep on sailing, long after today's court judgment.  

The damages were awarded to a number of entertainment companies, including Warner Bros, Sony Music Entertainment, EMI, and Columbia Pictures.
However, the total awarded fell short of the $17.5m in damages and interest the firms were seeking.
Speaking to the BBC, the chairman of industry body the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) John Kennedy said the verdict sent out a clear message.
"These guys weren't making a principled stand, they were out to line their own pockets. There was nothing meritorious about their behavior, it was reprehensible.
"The Pirate Bay did immense harm and the damages awarded doesn't even get close to compensation, but we never claimed it did.
"There has been a perception that piracy is OK and that the music industry should just have to accept it. This verdict will change that," he said.

The Pirate Bay's first server is now a museum exhibit in Stockholm
The four men denied the charges throughout the trial, saying that because they did not actually host any files, they were not doing anything wrong.
Speaking on Swedish Radio, assistant judge Klarius explained how the court reached its findings.
"The court first tried whether there was any question of breach of copyright by the file-sharing application and that has been proved, that the offense was committed.
"The court then moved on to look at those who acted as a team to operate the Pirate Bay file-sharing service, and the court found that they knew that material which was protected by copyright but continued to operate the service," he said.
A lawyer for Carl Lundstrom, Per Samuelson, told journalists he was shocked by the guilty verdict and the severity of the sentence.
"That's outrageous, in my point of view. Of course we will appeal," he was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. "This is the first word, not the last. The last word will be ours."
Political issue
Rickard Falkvinge, leader of The Pirate Party - which is trying to reform laws around copyright and patents in the digital age - told the BBC that the verdict was "a gross injustice".
"This wasn't a criminal trial, it was a political trial. It is just gross beyond description that you can jail four people for providing infrastructure.

Mark Mulligan from Forrester Research says what was different about Pirate Bay;

"There is a lot of anger in Sweden right now. File-sharing is an institution here and while I can't encourage people to break copyright law, I'm not following it and I don't agree with it.
"Today's events make file-sharing a hot political issue and we're going to take this to the European Parliament."
The Pirate Bay is the world's most high profile file-sharing website and was set up in 2003 by anti-copyright organization Piratbyran, but for the last five years it has been run by individuals.
Millions of files are exchanged using the service every day.
No copyright content is hosted on The Pirate Bay's web servers; instead the site hosts "torrent" links to TV, film and music files held on its users' computers.

OPERATION BAYLOUT: D-DAY

CALLING ALL PATRIOTS

Gentlemen. Allow me to introduce you to www.jaimelesartistes.fr. This despicable site (translation: "I love artists") is a propaganda engine for the recent French 3-strikes law that threatens any Frogfag accused of filesharing with being disconnected from the Internet. Yes, you read that correctly. A horrifying prospect, is it not? The French, under pressure from the IFPI and their allies - a bunch of money-grabbing j00s who haven't the faintest idea how2Internet but know enough to fear its potential to loosen their stranglehold on artistic expression - are adopting the Chinese-Iranian approach to the Internet. 

Your mission, should you choose not to be a boring moralfag, is simply to fire your lazors straight and true at this site (IP: 94.23.48.134) at the appointed time of 0400GMT on June 6. Why this time and day? Ask your grandparents what happened on June 6 1944. 

You will bring about the destruction of the IFPI war machine, the elimination of IFPI tyranny over the oppressed torrenters of France and security for ourselves on a free internet. Your task will not be an easy one. Your enemy is well trained, well equipped, and battle-hardened. He will fight savagely. But this is the year 2009. Much has happened since the IFPI's triumphs in the early days of file-sharing. Anonymous has inflicted upon the IPFI and its cronies great defeat in open battle man to man. Our DDoS, DDo$ and propaganda offensives have seriously reduced their standing on the internet and their capacity to wage war on our torrents. Our superior grasp of Computer Science III and our leet hacking toolz have given us an overwhelming superiority in weapons and munitions of raiding, and placed at our disposal great reserves of trained fighting anons. 

The tide has turned. 

The free anons of the world are marching together to victory. We have full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty, and skill in battle. We will accept nothing less than full victory. Good luck, and let us all beseech the blessings of Almighty Longcat upon this great and noble undertaking.

June 6. 0400 GMT. Well, whaddyaknow, looks like it's time to free France AGAIN. Head on over to IRC (irc.terogen.com #invasion) to join the motherfucking party. 


(Props Dwight D Eisenhower, the D Day Order Speech)



D-DAY: DEFEND DISTRIBUTION

Da-dahh! Desiring data and deliciousness, dastardly demonic dickheads decide to dethrone the deniers of dance and the dictators of dubstep. Deregulated distribution their demand; death, doom and destruction their designs. Distilling drama from dumbasses and defending the distinct and the delightful, this disparate Duma duly deems the dystopian directors' day of Destiny to be determined. 

Damn it, demonstrating the letter "D" definitely does drag in direct proportion to duration, so I'll simply add that you are personally invited to take part in D-Day, the liberation of France from the tyranny of the 3-strikes law against filesharing (no prizes for guessing who put Sarko up to that little stunt) in characteristic Transatlantic fashion. 

The landings commence, as they did 65 years ago, at 0400 GMT on June 6. Fire up your lazors and your Saving Private Ryan soundtracks. Get onto IRC at irc.terogen.com #invasion to find out more.

==New Raid:  DDO$ Attack==

The DDO$ raid is over due to the following reasons:
*They fixed the problem, no charge for anything under about 4 bucks.
*Friday already passed.
*it requires Anon to use IRL monies. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN, GUISE! liek, srsly...


== Victories ==
=== First Raid ===
Target: www.ifpi.org

Date: 4/20/09

Time: 00:00 A.M. / 12:00 A.M.

Description: The DDOS attack conducted on 4/20/09 at 00:00 A.M. GMT was successful. Approximately 700-1000 people joined in on the attack. An archive of some of the raid resources can be found here: http://anonym.to/http://seedsofliberty.webs.com/firstattackarchive.htm. The date of attack was planned out on Friday April 17, 2009 at approximately 10:00 P.M. GMT. Several IRC channels were donated to the cause with one having over 400 people in it at the time of the attack. The raid was done in response to the verdict on the case of the founders of thepiratebay.org. 

Raid Result: Successful. Website was taken down for 4–5 hours.

=== Second Raid ===
Target: www.maqs.com

Date: 4/23/09

Time: 00:00 A.M. / 12:00 A.M.

Description: Lasers were aimed at www.maqs.com. Lots of advertising newfaggotry went on in server. 
Some people are not able to understand the concept of a countdown and started to fire the lazers at [22:50]. www.maqs.com was hit by a botnet around 23:00, it went down pretty quick but went back up in around a half hour for the planned attack.

'''MAQS WENT DOWN ON OF 2009-04-23 00:36:08 GMT'''

Raid Result: Success: website was taken down twice during the night and the "under construction" page was down for a while after.

Some preliminary results from the first few minutes of the raid:

[http://anonym.to/http://i42.tinypic.com/20jipef.jpg http://anonym.to/http://i42.tinypic.com/20jipef.jpg]

By 12:40GMT (around) it seems www.maqs.com either disabled HTTPD, their host pulled their virtual server, or something similar.  Site was up, but there wasn't any content (serves their shared hosting's default under construction page). Later, the site's content was restored, and it is back to how it was before the raid.

=== Third Raid ===

*Any reports on what happened?

====DDoS====

'''GET IN IRC: irc.anonnet.org #tpb'''

=====WHEN and WHERE=====

:''' Run by the IFPI, this site is vulnerable to an easy DOS bug. An exploit is available on Milw0rm: <del>http://anonym.to/http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/3965</del> down, download the archive:<br /> http://anonym.to/http://insurgen.info/wiki/Milw0rm

:'''Or, simply write a script to repeatedly visit www.pro-music.org/AUX/.aspx Currently this exploit also works, if applied to the target's IP (87.84.226.198) instead to the domain. Better use 87.84.226.198/AUX/.aspx to avoid DNS based countermeasures.

We still need to decide when.
Timing must be engineered with several points in mind.  It may be impossible to satisfy every condition, but some points to consider are:
* Time zones:  The raid should be coordinated to involve a maximum number of people across as much of the globe as possible.  i.e.- 9:00AM EST is 3 PM in western Europe and 2 PM in the UK.
* Geographical Location of Target:  Countermeasures are less likely to be employed if the sysops is asleep, so it may be worth attacking outside of business hours if at all possible.

<s>'''The report piracy form is busted!'''</s>


Is this form even getting submitted?

:See line 267 of source

:<input type="image" name=%2526quot%253BImageButton1%2526quot%253B id="ImageButton1" src="submit_button.gif" onclick="DisableButton();" style="border-width:0px;" />

:--> onclick="DisableButton();" <--

Yes it is being submitted, see the js function it calls:

function DisableButton() {
         -->    document.forms[0].submit(); <--
                window.setTimeout("disableButton('" + 
                   window.event.srcElement.id + "')", 0);
            }

It just stops people from accidentally clicking submit twice.

Update: It looks like either something is broken or they disabled the backend server for this form, trying to submit gets an error message now

Update (6/7/09): Appears to work. Submitting only requires three fields: Piracy Type, Web Address, and Description. Fucking around with almost anything will get you a sexy looking error page though, the script wasn't made very carefully. Here's a greasemonkey for spamming:
