'''Fel0ny''' is a group of 6 skiddies, who have recently taken to pissing in Anonymous' koolaid at every opportunity. Having watched partyvan.info get hacked, as well as 711chan and 4chan getting DDoS'd, Anonymous has decided that enough is enough, and that it is time to give these failures a long, steel taste of assrape. An unnamed counter-organization has been formed to complete fel0ny's docs and to deal with them in the future.

There have been two incarnations of fel0ny: the first one responsible for the attacks in May (with the 6 pictured members), and a more recent one composed of Bash, redskull, LaZy, Shone, and Token. Mooncup and d0nk may be involved as well.

'''RECENT UPDATE'''
On 10.25.09, Fel0ny-Cyanide (who claimed to have retired 4 months prior) posted an update on Fel0ny.com with a screenshot of the 404'd "<nowiki>www.4chan.org/b/</nowiki>" (not <nowiki>img.4chan.org/b/</nowiki>), with the caption, "Remember this? I do…"
<br>
<br>
*mooncup, zerocide, and d0nk have been active on the root.the.web forums.
*fel0ny-fubar has been tracked down and docs are on their way.

=History=

Fel0ny had been around for some time, a small group that lurked on hackershood's IRC. According to them, their motive behind all of this was that they were annoyed at /b/tards coming into their IRC and annoying them.

On 05.09.09, the dormant fel0ny appeared to have reawoken, announcing this with a post:
{{tinyquote|Were Back! <br>
Posted by Administrator<br>
Yes folks...we are back...the host didn't like us so they suspended us...<br>
Here are some notes for Anonymous..<br>
http://anonym.to/http://fel0ny.com/ddos.JPG<br>
Your LOLIC,EPICFAILCANNON,LONGCAT,BWREAP wont help..<br>
See anonymous...we are an opponent that will not fight back, we will not sink to your level of kiddyness...So have fun!|Fel0ny-Cyanide}}

On 05.09.09 (during the 4chan DDoSing), this message was posted:
{{tinyquote|Fel0ny had a great laugh today when we all realized that /b/ appears to be no more, we are proud to spit on them and moot the “most influential person of the year” Ha I spit on that too, oh by the way fel0ny will continue to monitor the old /b/ link and once it comes down rest assured it will go down again. Hey 888chan don’t end up like this you fucking niggers!|Zerocide}}

On 05.31.09, Zerocide left fel0ny due to having his docs posted on /r9k/. Anonymous spent the next three days calling both Zerocide and his father's office, and many pizzas were reported to have been delivered. There was mention of a protest outside his trailer, with all participants wearing Guy Fawkes masks. It is unlikely that this actually happened.
{{tinyquote|ZeroCide has chosen to leave Fel0ny due to the last situation with 4chan and its members he does not feel that he would like to be apart of any groups that preform such attacks as us. He has stated he will pretty much be dropping offline from these types of groups for good, and will pickup his career again as a network technician for some of his old jobs who have offered to take him back.

Zerocide also told us that he would like to say goodbye to 4chan and all of its funny members who did call him, and he would also like to say that he has no hatred towards 4chan.|Bash}}

On 06.08.09, Cyanide left fel0ny due to internal conflicts and named Bash the new leader.

On 06.10.09, Bash made a post stating that fel0ny was disbanding, with the following message:
{{tinyquote|Fel0ny has decided to shut its doors today to keep its good name and gained fame for one of the best 4chan/7chan/711chan and last but not least 888chan trolls. Within this statement anyone claiming to be acting on the behalf of fel0ny-crew or fel0ny are lame posers who wish to steal our gained fame and ruin our name.|Bash}}

=Plans=
Reconnaissance mode: gather docs on fel0ny 2.0, just in case.
<br>
There are currently no targets to DDoS/BWRAEP.

==DOX==
*[http://anonym.to/http://pastebin.com/f68832d23 Here] Docs on the old members + Wang Ai
*[[Fel0ny/dox]] (plz2format with [[Template:Standard/Dox]]
<br>
Fel0ny-Cyanide claims on their forum that he planted the picture of himself along with the dox. It might not be the real thing...
<br>

=Raid Status=
Great success.

The fel0ny forums were taken down temporarily during the initial counterattack. However, this alone was not a win by any means, as the fel0ns do most of their dealings on IRC and MSN.

The success was that Anon invoked enough drama to have the original fel0ny disbanded.
