*Internet history is surprisingly quite as interesting as any description of World history, full of illustrous individuals, crushing wars, and the rise and fall of powerful websites.*

* [[Introduction|Internet_History]] - But of course, where to start? This article will tell you the basics of how the internet came together, and will direct you to other pages that tell a more in-depth story.

## The Beginning

* [[The_WELL]] - The ideas we hold true in our forums and social networks started here in this groundbreaking BBS.
* [[USENET]] - A special university-based BBS that had the option to be pseudo-anonymous. This place oversaw the cultivation of the Free Software movement, which ended up turning the GNU Project, now made complete with Linux, into a tangible product.

## 4chan and Anonymous

* [[Nanashi_World]] - 4chan and Anonymous draw strong parallels, and is actually descended from to a similar culture in Japan, the "Nameless World". Built of many colorful websites and BBSes like Ayashii World,
* [[Something_Awful]] - The site that gave 4chan it's community and culture should not itself be forgotten. These articles will unlock the paywall and allow us to understand what happened and what resided here, and how it fell into irrelevance later on. 
* [[4chan_History_Timeline]] - A nice, though somewhat incomplete timeline of how 4chan developed. Written by a random redditor, it was narrowly saved from being lost with the second [[Wikichan|Wiki#Wikichan]], and now resides here.
* [[4chan]] - A better article on how and why 4chan and it's community grew, and how it became so influential to modern internet culture today.
* [[The_Rise_of_Anonymous]] - For a while, [[Anonymous]]'s history parallels that of the site that bore it, 4chan. But as time went on, they went their seperate ways into a new future after [[Project Chanology]]. Exactly how did Anonymous come about, and what can we learn about successful raids in the past? 

## Social Networks

* [[MySpace]] - This place started the social network craze.
* [[Facebook]] - There's a reason that they made the story of Facebook's creation a blockbuster movie.
* [[Twitter]] - lolwut?

## General Internet Culture

* [[Significant_Memes]] - A simple collection of articles describing all the memes that we held dear years ago and have forgotten today. It takes the descriptions of [[ED|Wiki#Encyclopedia_Dramatica]], [[LURKMOAR_Wiki]], and condenses the basics into something that will explain old memes to users easily. 
* [[Significant_Raids]] - A sprawling description of raids that have been done by various groups on the internet, with in-depth coverage on how it was done.
