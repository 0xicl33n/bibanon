Welcome anons and internet users alike, I will cover the basics you need to know in order to do this successfully:
Note: The chances of you getting caught ( and consequently arrested) for this are minscule however it is always possible that you could. This is why we are going to use a vpn.

FIRSTLY: YOU CAN NOT DoS WITH TOR OR PROXIES, END OF.

What does a VPN do?
A VPN essentially masks your own IP, and replaces it with the IP of the tunnel you are connecting through. Thus making it very difficult to trace you back - not impossible however.

Paid VPN's (SAFE): 
We Suggest: http://www.anonine.se - The service have been started its for 49 SEK permonth

Free VPN's (These are useless as they keep logs):

ProXPN - http://proxpn.com/
This is a free VPN trial. Sign up on the website using FAKE information apart from the email address which you will need to use to verify the account. Use http://10minutemail.com for a temporary email address.
Once it is downloaded, follow the install procedure and then connect to the VPN network - during the trial version you have to use a Miami IP. Using the internet becomes painstakingly slow and you WILL disconnect from the irc after connection.

PrivateTunnel - http://privatetunnel.com
Same setup as for ProXPN, however the trial has a day limit. Slightly faster however.

DoSing the servers:

http://www.hping.org/download.php - Windows/Linux
Easy to use system, when it has downloaded for your appropriate OS please install and choose to use either tcp or udp packets.

http://ha.ckers.org/slowloris/ - Linux
This script is a http DoS script, you MUST have perl installed.

http://hoic.99k.org/ - Windows.
Much like hping, this is more powerful than LOIC and very easy to use, install and it should be clear from there.
