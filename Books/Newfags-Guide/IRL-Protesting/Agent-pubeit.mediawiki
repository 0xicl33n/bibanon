===Lyrics===

*Brave Agent Pubeit, Agent Pubeit was very brave
*Watch ye friends and ye shall see that he will win the day
*Deep underground with stone and trains, Vaseline was applied
*We handed him pubes, so many pubes, so he may complete his guise
*The path to victory and win, paved with pubes accumulated
*from the anonymous horde they came to him, fail he could not afford
*the various pubes they stuck to him from the Vaseline he put on before
*Brave Agent Pubeit came up from underground
*Covered in Vaseline and pubes, he emerged proud
*40 degrees in the streets, the streets
*here's where we got the call,
*Agent Pubeit the brave was on his way, free of delays and stalls
*verily he traveled on his way, the brave the brave the quick
*to the Church of Scientology to tell them to suck his dick
*the many they stared afraid they were for a thing they have not seen
*slippery and covered in pubic hair was the way it had to be
*Meanwhile back at our the base the attack had already begun
*Prank calls and our various faxes would ensure the battle was won
*A dozen proud preceded him serving to distract
*Incessant and vicious our calls they were, offensive and horrible our fax
*BRAVE Agent Pubeit, he was about to arrive
*At the Church of Scientology, his target could not hide
*Touch everyone and everything once he runs inside
*Pubes on their hands as they go to grab the gross slippery pube-covered guy
*Brave Agent Pubeit, Agent Pubeit ran away
*He knocked over shit and he got our pubes all over the place
*He touched three guys and they found out, how slippery one man could be
*He spread confusion and our dickhair, with his touch of Vaseline
*His mission complete it may seem, but there was more
*Three blocks away awaited another Scientology org
*The buildings two he strikes at thee, as he has once before
*The CLO headquarters did not know what they had in store
*Radioed in we attacked our target number two
*Let the enemies know that with them, Anonymous was not through
*Off the hook their phones rang as we directed our second push
*Agent Pubeit will soon come their way and deliver upon them some bush
*Brave Agent Pubeit, safely got away
*Scientology we strike at thee because you're fucking gay
*Your buildings both we hath spread, our agent covered in pubes
*Remember this day we have delivered Operation: Slickpubes
