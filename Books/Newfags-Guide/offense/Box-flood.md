Box Floods happen to be one of the most time-honored traditions of the /i/nsurgency. All you need is an address and an online postal account. Within a week or two, your victim will receive thousands upon thousands of boxes. They will litter his front yard and piss off neighbors. He won't be able to get rid of them easily without dealing with the post office, and they will probably call the cops on the victim for mail fraud. This is one of the greatest tactics of /i/ and it's been proven time and time again.

* Step 1: Create an account on USPS.com using a valid email.
* Step 2: Go to USPS's store and order all the FREE boxes and mailing envelopes.
* Step 3: Confirm the address and purchase. 
That's it. Easy and bound to cause the victim lots of headaches.
