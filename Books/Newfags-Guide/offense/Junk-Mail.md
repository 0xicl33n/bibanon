Everybody hates junkmail. Spread it. You'll have to be a little creative with this, though. A lot of websites and newsletters now make you confirm your address before sending thousands upon thousands of emails. So if your victim is in control of the email still, to start receiving the junk you send to him he'll probably have to confirm it. There are still some websites who send out junk mail without confirmation:

## Religious Spam  ##

Some of the most insane fucking people happen to be religious. They go around telling others how to live in some kind of attempt to save their soul. Send them free bibles, free religious newsletters, add their phone number to local churches. Religious people do not give up easily. Your victim will be bombarded 24/7 by attempts to save his soul.
A good site for free shit is [Christian Freebies](http://anonym.to/http://www.christianityfreebies.com/index.cfm). You'll need a valid email address to confirm.

## Huge Tip  ##

If you create an e-mail, you can set it to send all mail to another account, last time checked hotmail doesn't need a confirmation code, try and start there, make a new e-mail, subscribe to a bunch of stuff, have it all sent away after you confirm :), thank you, and have a nice day

## Tell-A-Friend  ##

One of the most under-appreciated email spam tactics are "Tell-A-Friend" forms. Most often these forms are ancient and have spaces for multiple emails that do not check for duplicates. If you go to almost any website they will have Tell-A-Friend forms. Simply copy-paste the address of the email into all available slots, and send. It's even better if you use iMacros or another automated program to do this.
This tactic is one of the best since you can effectively turn any website into your own personal mail server.
