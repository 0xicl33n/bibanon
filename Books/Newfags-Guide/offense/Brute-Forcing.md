Brute Forcing is a method of cracking passwords, that involves rotating through randomized strings until the correct one is discovered.  There are two forms of brute force attacks--one is dictionary style, where many pre-made strings are tried, while the other creates random strings from random numbers/integers.  The former is faster, but does not always work, while the latter is slowpoke but will eventually get it.
