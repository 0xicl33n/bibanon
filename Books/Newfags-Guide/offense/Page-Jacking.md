Page Jacking is an old porn masters trick to drag the competitors site into irrelevance on Google etc. Porn masters use a ratio of 6:1 (Page Jacks to Target URL) effectively. Each Jack site will adversely affect ALL duplicated content just as soon as Google finds it. Relevance in search engines is further degraded by all the 404's & Porn.
When Co$ finds it, they will ALWAYS file a DMCA claim, and cause a trainwreck themselves. They'll spend their lives in contact with Google/Yahoo etc etc getting all the copies of their shit removed. 
Page Jacking still works. unlike error 302, long time settled.

## Method ##

Since the Pool is always closed, let's rape Narconon, for example.

1. Save the graphics on the right in a separate folder for convenience.
1. Use [HTTrack](http://anonym.to/http://www.httrack.com) to download a complete copy of your favorite Narconon website.
1. Use [No_Narconon.exe](http://anonym.to/http://scientrology.org/special/No_Narconon_001.exe) to change the original graphics our own graphics. (You might need the [VB Runtime files](http://anonym.to/http://scientrology.org/special/vbrun60sp6.zip) if it won't run.)
1. Get a free webhost such as <http://anonym.to/http://www.free-webhosts.com/webhosting-01.php>
1. Make the domain or subdomain as similar as possible to "drug-rehab" or the domain name of the target. (like Narconon) Use a disposable email account because you'll get spammed like crazy for signing up, it helps the freehosts to stay in business.
1. Upload the entire contents of the website folder into your free host. Use [Filezilla](http://anonym.to/http://filezilla-project.org/) or the web interface provided to upload.
1. Finally... post a link to your new creation somewhere busy for Google to find. Done
1. ????
1. PROFIT!
Do enough of these and watch Google for your websites.
