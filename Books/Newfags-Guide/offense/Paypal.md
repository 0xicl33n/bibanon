## PayPal button

Has a PayPal button on his site. If you can think of a way to raep, we're all ears.
I have thought of a way to rape indeed. Basically, make a paypal account with say 5 dollars in it 

now, donate this 5 dollars to him, ONE PENNY AT A TIME. Every time such a tiny payment is made, he actually gets a small fee of about 40 cents. So for every penny you donate to him, he loses 40 cents. You donate one dollar? He loses forty. You do the math. The easiest way is donate to him $5 or whatever and then charge-back the donation so it takes the money back out of his account AND charges him a service fee. Now he owes the donation money and the charge-back money. RAEP! 

--Don't forget, you can always challenge (or w/e the freakin word is) the donation and PayPal will refund you + charge him more. LULZ!!11--
