Maybe you've been stalking some chick on myspace and you wanna find out more about her (AKA see her naked), OR maybe you're trying to compile some mad [Dox](/Dox) against a target or simply trying to find some blackmail material. Regardless, this method works well for finding private pictures of alot myspace users by accessing their photobucket accounts.

# Find the profile #

Okay so you found her profile, but it's private. Fuck, okay, shit.
Okay, you need to find some nudez or atleast some more pics, right?

# Find the vulnerability #

Wait- what is this little heart image next to her picture?
![](Heart.jpg)
Right click on that mutha fucka and goto "View Image."

Oh shi- the url of the heart image contains her photobucket username!
Maybe we can access her photobucket?
Let's try it!
NOTE: In the case that the profile is not private, you can still find random images on their myspace and try to see if any of them are hosted on photobucket and contain the target's photobucket username in the urls.

# Get in to the photobucket #

Simply delete the image filename (in this case, "heart.png") from the end of the url, so you're left with: 
`<http://s259.photobucket.com/albums/hh314/daddyslittleslut69/>`
This new link will take us to her photobucket account.

# Find the goods #

Once in the photobucket, you gotta find the goods.
In the case that the target's photobucket album is private, you need to use a fuskering program to find pictures. Read the section below for more information.
WTF? There's no hot pictures in here! Just shitty myspace glam pics...

NVM! Found it!

Click on the album named "naked" and enjoy the win!

# Cracker #

In the event that said Photobucket account is private, use [Photofucket](http://photofucket.kicks-ass.org/) or [Navnet](http://navnetapp.com/) to fusker for pics at incredibly high rates(photofucket is faster I think and less resource-heavy imo). You can also use a [Javascript Fuskerer](http://members.home.nl/bas.de.reuver/files/fusker.html) to do this on other sites
besides photobucket.
