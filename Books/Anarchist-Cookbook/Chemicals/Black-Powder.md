First made by the Chinese for use in fireworks, black powder was first
used in weapons and explosives in the 12th century.  It is very simple to
make, but it is not very powerful or safe.  Only about 50% of black powder is
converted to hot gasses when it is burned; the other half is mostly very fine
burned particles.  Black powder has one major problem: it can be ignited by
static electricity.  This is very bad, and it means that the material must be
made with wooden or clay tools.

## Improvised Black Powder (Recipe 1)

Black powder can be prepared in a simple, safe manner. It may be used as 
blasting or gun powder.

### Material Required

Potassium Nitrate, granulated, 3 cups (3/4 liter)
Wood charcoal, powdered, 2 cups
Sulfur, powdered, 1/2 cup
Alcohol, 5 pints (2-1/2 liters) (whiskey, rubbing alcohol, etc.)
Water, 3 cups (3/4 liter)
Heat source
2 buckets - each 2 gallon (7-1/2 litres) capacity, at least one of which is 
     heat resistant (metal, ceramic, etc.)
Flat window screening, at least 1 foot (30 cm) square
Large wooden stick
Cloth, at leat 2 feet (60 cm) square

### Procedure

1. Place alcohol in one of the buckets.
2. Place potassium nitrate, charcoal, and sulfur in the heat resistant 
bucket. Add 1 cup water and mix thoroughly with wooden stick until all 
ingrediants are dissolved.
3. Add remaining water (2 cups) to mixture. Place bucket on heat source and 
stir until small bubbles begin to form.
* **CAUTION**: DO NOT boil mixture. Be sure ALL mixture stays wet. If any is dry, as on sides of pan, it may ignite!
4. Remove bucket from heat and pour mixture into alcohol while stirring 
vigorously.
5. Let alcohol mixture stand about 5 minutes. Strain mixture through cloth to 
obtain black powder. Discard liquid. Wrap cloth around black powder and 
squeeze to remove all excess liquid.
6. Place screening over dry bucket. Place workable amount of damp powder on 
screen and granulate by rubbing solid through screen. NOTE: If granulated 
particles appear to stick together and change shape, recombine entire batch 
of powder and repeat steps 5 & 6.
7. Spread granulated black powder on flat, dry surface so that layer about 
1/2 inch (1-1/4 cm) is formed. Allow to dry. Use radiator, or direct 
sunlight. This should be dried as soon as possible, preferably in an hour. 
The longer the drying period, the less effective the black powder.

CAUTION: Remove from heat AS SOON AS granules are dry. Black powder isnow 
ready to use.

## Recipe 2

A misguided individual could
manufacture black powder at home with the following procedure:

     MATERIALS               EQUIPMENT
     ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ               ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
     potassium               clay grinding bowl
     nitrate (75 g)          and clay grinder

       or                         or

     sodium                  wooden salad bowl
     nitrate (75 g)          and wooden spoon

     sulfur (10 g)           plastic bags (3)

     charcoal (15 g)         300-500 ml beaker (1)

     distilled water         coffee pot or heat source

1. Place a small amount of the potassium or sodium nitrate in the grinding
 bowl and grind it to a very fine powder.  Do this to all of the potassium or
 sodium nitrate, and store the ground powder in one of the plastic bags.
2. Do the same thing to the sulfur and charcoal, storing each chemical in a
separate plastic bag.
3. Place all of the finely ground potassium or sodium nitrate in the beaker,
   and add just enough boiling water to the chemical to get it all wet.
4. Add the contents of the other plastic bags to the wet potassium or sodium
nitrate, and mix them well for several minutes.  Do this until there is no
more visible sulfur or charcoal, or until the mixture is universally black.
5. On a warm sunny day, put the beaker outside in the direct sunlight.
  Sunlight is really the best way to dry black powder, since it is never too
  hot, but it is hot enough to evaporate the water.
6. Scrape the black powder out of the beaker, and store it in a safe
 container. Plastic is really the safest container, followed by paper.  Never
 store black powder in a plastic bag, since plastic bags are prone to generate
 static electricity.
