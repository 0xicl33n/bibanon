ANARCHY 'N' EXPLOSIVES

## Prelude

   For you people that like blowing things up and shit like that, here's
 something that's not as dangerous or as difficult as more of the explosives
 available (or able to create)... It's called the LN2 Bomb (Short for Liquid
 Nitrogen Bomb). Very easy to make:

         Ingredients:     1 Plastic Two Litre Bottle
                            Enough Liquid Nitrogen To Fill The Bottle

         Instructions:    Fill the bottle with liquid nitrogen. Then cap
                          as tightly as possible. The vaporization of the
                          nitrogen will create enough pressure in the
                          bottle (within 5-15 minutes) to break it with
                          a quite strong explosive force... Very Easy...

                        USE AT YOUR OWN RISK....

## Volume 2

    This volume defines a few varieties of misc explosives, charges, and
       whatever I had in mind at that time. Anyway, these formulas are not
       as precise in measurements for they were given in brief summary.
       However, they will work, and if used correctly can be safe and "fun".

    FRENCH AMMONAL:
-------------------
            Type: Low Explosive
     Ingredients: 86% Ammonium Nitrate
                   6% Stearic Acid
                   8% Aluminum Powder
     Description: French ammonal is an easily improvised low explosive
                  mixture. It is generally less effective than an equal
                  weight of TNT. The material is loaded by pressing it into
                  a suitable container. Initiation by an Engineer's special
                  blasting cap is recommended.
        Comments: This material was tested. It is effective.
      References: TM 31-201-1, Unconventional Warfare Devices and Techniques,
                  para 1401.

    TETRYTOL:
-------------
            Type: High Explosive
     Ingredients: 75% Tetryl
                  25% TNT
     Description: Tetryol is a high explosive bursting charge. It is used as
                  a demolition explosive, a bursting charge for mines, and
                  in artillery shells. The explosive force of tetrytol is
                  approximately the same as that of TNT. It may be initiated
                  by a blasting cap. Tetrytol is usually loaded by casting.
        Comments: This material was tested. It is effective.

                  TM 9-1910, Military Explosives, page 188.

    IMPROVISED PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE FILLER:
----------------------------------------
            Type: High Explosive
     Ingredients: Finely Powdered Potassium Chlorate Cdata  bstals
                  Petroleum Jelly        **MIX THOUROUGHLY**
     Description: This plastic explosive filler can be detonated with a
                  No. 8 commercial blasting cap or with any military
                  blasting cap. The explosive must be stored in a waterproof
                  container until ready to use.
        Comments: This material was tested. It is effective.
      References: TM 31-210, Improvised Munitions, sec I, No. 1.

    FLAMABILITY OF GASES:
-------------------------
            Type: Gas Explosive
     Ingredients: Explosive Gas
     Description: Under some conditions, common gases act as fuel. When mixed
                  with air, they will burn rapidly or even explode. For some
                  fuel-air mixtures, the range over which the explosion can
                  occur is quite wide while for others the limits are narrow.
                  The upper and lower amounts of common fuels that will cause
                  an ignitable mixture are shown in the table below. The
                  quantity shown is the percentage by volume of air. If the
                  fuel-air mixture is too lean or too rich, it will not
                  ignite. The amounts shown are therefore called limits of
                  inflamability.
                                                   Gases (% by volume of air)
                  Fuel (Gas)                       Lower Limit    Upper Limit
                  -------------------------------  -----------    -----------
                  Water Gas Or Blue Gas                7.0             72
                  Natural Gas                          4.7             15
                  Hydrogen                             4.0             75
                  Acetylene                            2.5             81
                  Propane                              2.2             10
                  Butane                               1.9              9

        Comments: These fuels have been tested under labratory conditions.
                  They are effective. Ignition depends on method of
                  initiation, uniformity of mixture, and physical conditions.

## Volume 3

  This is the MOST important or one of the most important volumes regarding
the various mixtures of anarchy that I will be "publishing" to the "public".
Also, it may as well be the MOST DANGEROUS to prepare, the substance we will
be dealing with is Trinitrotoluene, or short - TNT. This high expolosive
is a VERY DANGEROUS, slightly unstable substance. The crystalized crude TNT
is about the color of brown sugar and feels greasy to the touch. It is
suitable for many uses as a high-explosive, but not for the use in high-
explosive shells. It is also highly reactive to many other chemical
substances. It can be incorporated into dynamite and many other explosives
that will be explained in further detail later, in other volumes of ANARCHY.

                                   WARNING:
  DO NOT ATTEMPT TO FINISH THIS PROJECT UNLESS YOU ARE FULLY CAPABLE SAFELY
  EXECUTING THE PROCESSES IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT! IF YOU CHOOSE TO CONTINUE,
    READ THE INSTRUCTIONS COMPLETELY THROUGH BEFORE BEGINNING AND HAVE ALL
  MATERIALS AND TOOLS (INCLUDING SAFETY/EMERGENCY EQUIPTMENT) READY FOR USE
  WHEN OR IF THEY ARE NEEDED. THIS IS NOT A JOKE! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!!

  Preparation of Trinitrotoluene (Three Stages). A mixture of 294 grams
    of concentrated sulfuric acid (density 1.84) and 147 grams of nitric
    acid (density 1.42) is added slowly from a dropping funnel to 100
    grams of toluene in a tall 600-cc. beaker, while the liquid is stirred
    vigorously with an electric stirrer and it's temperature is maintained
    at 30 to 40 degrees celsius by running cold water in the vessel in
    which the beaker is standing. The addition of acid will require from an
    hour to an hour and a half. The stirring is then continued for half an
    hour longer without cooling; the mixture is allowed to stand over night
    in a separatory funnel; the lower layer of spent acid is drawn off; and
    the crude mononitrotoluene is weighed. One-half of it, corresponding to
    50 grams of toluene, is taken for the dinitration.
      The mononitrotoluene (MNT) is dissolved in 109 grams of concentrated
    sulfuric acid (d. 1.84) while the mixture is cooled in running water.
    The solution in a tall beaker is warmed to 50 degrees
  and a mixed acid,
    composed of 54.5 grams each of nitric acid (d. 1.50) and sulfuric acid
    (d. 1.84), is added slowly drop by drop from a dropping funnel while
    the mixture is stirred mechanically. The heat generated by the reaction
    raises the temperature, and the rate of addition of the acid is regulated
    so that the temperature of the mixture lies always between 90 degrees
    and 100 degrees. The addition of the acid will require about 1 hour.
    After the acid has been added, the mixture is stirred for 2 hours longer
    at 90-100 degrees to complete the nitration. Two layers seperate on
    standing. The upper layer consists largely of dinitrotoluene (DNT), but
    probobly contains a certain amount of TNT. The trinitration in the
    laboratory is converniently carried out without separating the DNT from
    the spent acid.

      While the dinitration mixture is stirred actively at a temperature of
    about 90 degrees, 145 grams of fuming sulfuric aced (oleum containing
    15% free SO3) is added slowly by pouring from a beaker. A mixed acid,
    composed of 72.5 grams each of nitric acid (d. 1.50) and the 15% oleum,
    is now added drop by drop with good agitation while the heat of the
    reaction maintains the temperature at 100-115 degrees. After about
    three-quarters of the acid has been added, it will be found necessary
    to apply external heat to maintain the temperature. After all the acid
    has been added (taking 1 1/2 to 2 hours), the heating and stirring are
    continued for 2 hours longer at 100-115 degrees. After the material has
    stood overnight, the upper TNT layer will be found to have solidified
    to a hard cake, and the lower layer of spent acid to be filled with
    cdata  bstals. The acid is filtered through a Buchner funnel (without filter
    paper), and the cake is broken up and washed with water on the same
    filter to remove excess of acid. The spent acid contains considerable
    amounts of TNT in solution; this is precipitated by pouring the acid
    into a large volume of water, filtered off, rinsed with water, and added
    to the main batch. All the of the product is washed three or four times
    by agitating it vigorously with hot water under which it is melted.
    After the last washing, the TNT is  granulated by allowing it to cool
    slowly under hot water while the stirring is continued. The product,
    filtered off and dried at ordinary room temperature, is equal to a good
    commercial sample of crude TNT. It may be purified by dissolving in warm
    alcohol at 60 degrees and allowing to cool slowly, or it may be purified
    by digesting with 5 times its weight of 5% sodium hydrogen sulfite
    solution at 90 degrees for half an hour with vigorous stirring, washing
    with hot water until the washings are colorless, and finally granulating
    as before. The product of this last treatment is equal to a good
    commercial sample of purified TNT. Pure ALPHA-TNT, melting point 80.8
    degrees, may be procured by recrystallizing this material once from
    nitric acid (d. 1.42) and once from alcohol.

                 Well, that's it... AND REMEMBER MY WARNING!

## Volume 4

   In this particular volume, we will be discussing types of Dynamite,
these high-explosives being one of the more important or destructive of the
anarchist's formulas. Note that some of these mixtures are very unstable or
shock ignited, and that care should be observed when handling these unstable
mixtures. Some of these formulae deal with Trinitrotoluene (TNT) and the
preparation for that is given under the volume 3, within this series.

                                   WARNING:
THESE ARE REAL EXPLOSIVES AND MAY CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH UPON MISUSE.
  DO NOT ATTEMPT TO PREPARE ANY AS SAMPLE IF YOU ARE NOT FULLY CAPABLE OF
UNDERSTANDING THE DANGERS AND PRECAUTIONS OF THESE PRODUCTS. THESE FORMULAE
   ARE THE TRUE FORMULAE TO CREATE THESE MIXTURES AND ARE THEREFORE VERY
                      DANGEROUS. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!

Guhr Dynamite:
  Ingredients-  1 part Kieselguhr
                3 parts Nitroglycerin

  Description- This dynamite is primarily used in blasting. It is fairly
               stable, in the drop test, it exploded by the fall of a 1 kg
               weight through 12 to 15 cm., or by the fall of a 2 kg weight
               through 7 cm. The frozen material is less sensitive: a drop of
               more than 20 cm. with a 1 kg weight is needed to explode it,
               and the 2 kg weight is necessary to explode it. Frozen or
               unfrozen, it can be detonated by shooting at it with a
               military rifle, when held in a paper cartridge. Generally,
               it is detonated with a steel-on-steel blow. Velicity of
               detonation vary from 6650 to 6800 meters per second at a
               density loading of 1.50.

Extra-Dynamite:
  Ingredients-      FORMULA 1                   FORMULA 2

## Volume 5

     Well, hasn't it been long since Volume 4 of Anarchy 'n' Explosives?
Well, I finally got around to typing up another volume. This one will be
dedicated to the extremely simple and more accessible explosives and
incendiaries to be prepared at home, or laboratory; depending upon the
environment you have access to or are accustomed to.

     Anyway, getting back down to business, I must (again), put up this sign:

         WARNING: THESE EXPLOSIVES/INCENDIARIES ARE REAL, NOT TOYS. USE
          EXTREME CAUTION WHEN PREPARING AND APPLYING WHEN APPLICABLE.
                 FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT IN INJURY OR DEATH.
                              USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

          Enough  of the warnings and notes; for further information and/or
     comments  on  this  series  of  ever popular explosives, contact me (I
     don't  sign  these  "publications") on the Knavery BBS at xxx-xxx-xxxx
     on  the  public message base, I should be reading some requests if you
     leave  them.  And,  volume  number 6 should be coming out sooner than
     the time between 4 and 5, but don't count on it.

BULK POWDERS:
=============

      Bulk  powders are types of gunpowders consisting of nitrocellulose and a
mixture  of  other chemically explosive solutions. These nitrocellulose fibers
are  stuck together, but are not completely collided. Some contain little else
but  nitrocellulose;  others  contain,  in  addition  to  potassium and barium
nitrates,  camphor, vaseline, paraffin, lampblack, starch, dextrine, potassium
dichromate  or  other  oxidizing  or  deterrent  salts,  and diphenylamine for
stabilization, and are colored in a variety of brilliant hues by means of col-
tar  dyes. Three typical bulk powders are made up according to the approximate
formulas tabulated below:

         Nitrocellulose........................ 84.0   87.0   89.0
           % N in nitrocellulose............... 13.2   12.9   12.9
         Potassium nitrate.....................  7.5    6.0    6.0
         Barium nitrate........................  7.5    2.0    3.0
         Starch................................  -.-    -.-    1.0
         Paraffin oil..........................  -.-    4.0    -.-
         Diphenylamine.........................  1.0    1.0    1.0

      The  mixture  is  mixed  in warm water and dried thoroughly. Then either
granulated  or  made  into powder by crushing with a wooden block and screened
through  a  12-mesh sieve. The material is then stored in a moisture-resistant
container for future or immediate use.

MERCURY FULMINATE:
==================
      Mercury  fulminate  is  an  initiating  explosive, commonly appearing as
white  or  gray  crystals.  It  is  extremely sensitive to initiation by heat,
friction,  spark  or  flame, and impact. It detonates when initiated by any of
these  means.  It  is pressed into containers, usually at 3000 psi, for use in
detonators  and blasting caps. However, when compressed at greater and greater
pressure  (up to 30,000 psi), it becomes "dead pressed." In this condition, it
can  only  be detonated by another initial detonating agent. Mercury fulminate
gradually  becomes inert when stored continuously above 100 degrees F. A dark-
colored  product  of  deterioration  gives  evidence  of  this effect. Mercury exfulminate  is  stored underwater except when there is danger of freezing. Then
it is stored under a mixture of water and alcohol.

     Preparation  of  Mercury  Fulminate. Five grams of mercury is addedExt55 
cc.  of nitric acid (specific gravity 1.42) in a 100-cc. Erlenmeyer flask, and
the  mixture  is  allowed  to stand without shaking until the mercury has gone
into  solution. The acid liquid is then poured into 50 cc. of 90% alcohol in a
500-cc.  beaker  in the hood. The temperature of the mixture rises, a vigorous
reaction  commences,  white  fumes  come  off,  and cdata  bstals of fulminate soon
begin  to precipitate. Red fumes appear and the precipitation of the fulminate
becomes  more  rapid,  then white fumes again as the reaction moderates. After
about  20  minutes, the reaction is over; water is added, and the cdata  bstals are
washed  with  water repeatedly by decantation until the washings are no longer
acid   to  litmus.  The  product  consists  of  grayish-yellow  cdata  bstals,  and
corresponds  to a good grade of commercial fulminate. It may be obtained white
and  entirely  pure  by  dissolving  in  strong  ammonia water, filtering, and
reprecipitating  by  the  addition  of  30% acetic acid. The pure fulminate is
filtered  off,  washed  several times with cold water, and stored under water,
or,  if  a very small amount is desired for experimental purposes, it is dried
in a desiccator.

AMATOL:
=======

      Description:  amatol is a high explosive, whit to buff in color. It is a
mixture  of  ammonium  nitrate and TNT, with a relative effectiveness slightly
higher  than  that  of  TNT  alone. Common compositions vary from 80% ammonium
nitrate  and  20%  TNT  to 40% ammonium nitrate and 60% TNT. Amatol is used as
the  main  bursting  charge  in  artillery  shells  and  bombs. Amatol absorbs
moisture  and  can  form dangerous compounds with copper and brass. Therefore,
it should not be housed in containers of such metals.

BLACK POWDERS:
==============

      Black  powders  burn  either  quickly  or  very  slowly depending on the
composition  of  such  a  mixture; however, these powders produce smoke, often
great  amounts,  and  is most useful in applications where smoke is no object.
It  is  the  best for communicating fire and for producing a quick, hot flame.
Black  powder  is  used  in  both  propellant  charges for shrapnel shells, in
saluting  and  blank  fire  charges, as the bursting charge of practice shells
and  bombs,  as a propelling charge in certain pyrotechnic pieces, and, either
with  or  without  the  admixture of other substances which modify the rate of
burning,  in the time-train rings and in other parts of fuses. Below is a list
of black powders and their compositions.
