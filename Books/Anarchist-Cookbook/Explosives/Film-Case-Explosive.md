Easy explosive:

-fill Kodak film case (y'know, the black cylinder with the grey cap) 
with explosive of your choice.  Drill hole in grey lid, insert fuse, 
and tape it back together very tightly.  Light.

                        or:

-poke a hole it the grey cap facing outwards, and insert an M-80 
with fuse going through the hole and reseal, taping it tightly ALL 
AROUND the case.  Place in plastic mailbox, light, close door, and 
get the hell away!  Because of the tight airspace, the destructive 
power of the explosion is increased 5X.  Works under water too, with 
a drop of wax, or preferably rubber cement around where the cap and 
wick meet.
                         
                         and:

-fill a GLASS coke/pepsi bottle with 1 part gas, 1 part sugar, & 1 
part water. Wedge an M-80 into the top about halfway.  Shake the 
container, place in mailbox (hopefully with mail {hehe!}) light, and 
get the fuck away.  This thing sends glass shrapnel EVERYWHERE, 
including through their mail.
