This page details the complete history of 4chan in the format of a conventional college-level history book.

4chan's history is to be divided into concurrent periods, like that of Japanese history. Each era was dominated by different immigrant groups from other websites, who imported the funniest memes of their culture into the melting pot of /b/.

## Help

This page needs to be enhanced, perhaps turned into a book.

The [[4chan History Timeline]] is a great source of information, though it thins out near the end of 2007. Cole Stryker's [[Epic Win For Anonymous]] is also awesome, though it comes from an carpetbagger's point of view.

_Below is a small plan of the sections we are planning. You're free to change this as needed._

## Prehistory (1996-2003) 

The background of the world that 4chan was started in.

## Genesis (2003-2004)

> _And Legion said, Let the newfags lurk and learn the way. They shall be Anonymous, and forgive not, and never forget, and raep the weak: and catch the Phish of the sea, and throw shit at the fowl of the air, and lord over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. - [[The Book of Genesis]], [[The Book of Anon]]_

4chan is founded in 2003 as an english-language version of Futaba Channel. The site introduces a simpler and freer method of communication that [[Something Awful]] users have always dreamed of. It soon becomes wildly popular as a new home for banned [[ADTRW]] refugees, who in turn spread word across the internet. During this era, the first tenets of 4chan culture are created by ADTRW and 2chan. 4chan links quickly replace Futaba Channel links on ADTRW. Once Lowtax begins to create a Soviet-style police state of arbitrary rules on SA (which cost users their $15 accounts), 4chan quickly rose beyond the tired, old site.

## Mootxico Era (2004-2006) 

In a reactionary move towards the rise of 4chan, [[Lowtax]] begins to create a Soviet-style police state of arbitrary rules on SA (which cost users their $15 accounts). 4chan's free and anonymous posting, lenient moderation, and SA-influenced culture proves to be an appealing alternative, like Colonial America for disinherited Englishmen.

Once Moot grows up to legally visit his own site, (he is 16-18 at this point), he slowly opens up to the 4chan community, earning the term "the Mootxico" era.

4chan's culture begins to stabilize at this point, as a world of hatred, anonymity, truth in opinion, and trolling. It is an interesting counterexample to the rise of social media occuring at the same time. Some of the original users begin to thin out as they lose interest, but are just as quickly replaced by SA refugees. 4chan becomes a fast changing society beginning to carve out it's own culture and place in the world.

## Civil War Era (2006 - 2007)

4chan's momentous Civil War Era begins with moot's dismissal of moderators [[W.T. Snacks]] and [[Shii]], seen by many anons as a harbringer of impending doom. And doom seemed imminent for all; with exponentially increasing immigration, 4chan's /b/ had begun to experience sharp cultural changes that left long time users bewildered and newfags unassimilated. 

During this era, the (initially) inexperienced 4chan community gets it's first experience with internet warfare in the coalition attack against [[Ebaums World]] for it's plagarism, and later [[Haboo Hotel]]. Raids soon become commonplace on /b/ for the first time. School shooting plans and stadium bombings are posted by 4channers attracted to the sense of anonymity.

The massive increase of threads proportionally increased the rate of thread deletion. Although the ratio of good to bad content changed little, the sheer magnitude of forgettable, rehashed content created class conflict with "oldfags" and "newfags". There was a hankering for a romanticized depiction of /b/ as an idyllic place where all content was original, funny, and fresh. While this belief could not be farther from the truth, the cynical ideal quickly became a major tenet of 4chan culture.

4chan's nominal anonymity begins to attract a bunch of colorful groups to 4chan, such as [[Touhou]] fans, guro lovers, pedophiles, and worst of all, [[Furries]].  Most of these groups are given their own boards to keep them out of the other ones, but curiously, Furries have not. A persecution complex causes them to react badly to criticism, and minor distaste evolves into total hatred that threatens to destroy the boards. 

When the 4chan mods begin to impose much tighter rules, a number of /b/tards leave 4chan for dead and abandon en masse. A declaration of independence is made that establishes [[Anonymous]] as a seperate group with it's home anywhere but 4chan. Ironically, during the following Golden Age, their diffusion of 4chan memes around the internet will only solidify it's position as the ultimate center of internet culture.

### Raids of this period

* [[Habbo Raids]]

## Golden Age (2006-2007)

The term "Golden Age" does not refer to a lost time of actually funny and original content, or any sense of Victorian elegance, but to a time where 4chan began to become the center of internet, and even popular culture in the same manner as [[2channel]] in Japan. With ever greater growth, the era managed to produce a huge amount of high-quality content in a self-fulfilling cycle. But the same growth produced a proportional amount of reposts, "newfaggotry", and forgettable threads. This title was truly a mixed blessing with no correct generalization.

On November 7, 2006, 4chan was taken down when moot was unable to pay for 4chan's increasing traffic costs. Anons scoured the internet, looking for a worthy candidate to inherit the crown of the hubsite of Anonymous, but to no avail. Each of the other major chans, ([[7chan]], [[12chan]], [[420chan]]) themselves went down due to the sudden surge of traffic, sometimes permanently. The dream of the Civil War Era, of an independent Anonymous, slowly faded once the anons realized that there was no suitable subsitute for 4chan.

Not long before this, increased migration to and from 4chan had pushed it's culture memes into the forefront of internet fame. Something Awful users emulating 4chan's Caturday sparked an observer to create [[I can haz cheezburger]], which began, and later monetized, the meme industry outside of 4chan. On the fledging site [[Youtube]], 4chan users created and popularized Tay Zonday's [[Chocolate Rain]] and an adaptation of the [[Duckroll]] for video, known as the [[Rickroll]]. The Rickroll would later become the most definitive meme of the era. 4chan trolls spread across the internet to cause more rage. Newfags come in expecting a hacker playground, and after the Fox News report on Anonymous, 4chan's /b/ eventually regains a strong raid mentality that the mods have given up stopping. 

But the rise of the meme industry, produced unwanted interest in the site that created it all. The social problems of population growth, mainstream appeal, and problematic subcultures reached it's greatest crescendo in the Golden Age, and it is seen by many anons as 4chan's [[Eternal September]].

## Chanology Era (2008-2009) 

On January 2008, a well-known video of Tom Cruise going crazy on a Scientology training video was censored on Youtube by the Church of [[Scientology]]. A raid thread was immediately posted on 4chan's /b/, detailing the other illegal and immoral acts that the group has pulled off. With near-unanimous support, this thread began a massive operation by [[Anonymous]] to rid the world of the scourge of Scientology once and for all, through DDoS and protest. The coming events came to be known as [[Project Chanology]], resulting in major victories over Scientologists, the use of large IRL protests, and mass media coverage due to these protests.

As time went on, the initial enthusiasm for the raid wore off, and participants of Project Chanology realized that 4chan was not the best place for organized assault. These people temporarily left 4chan for seperate sites, like [[711chan]], various IRC channels, and [[Why We Protest]]. The split established [[Anonymous]] as a powerful force for "hacktivism", independent of 4chan. 

Strong social changes within Chanology after an influx of non-4chan immigrants causes Anonymous to take an unfamiliar face, as a force for good rather than the embodiment of evil.

## Boxxy Era (2009-2010)

By this point in time, Project Chanology has long faded with only a few stalwart holdouts, and the majority of [[Anonymous]] reassimilates into 4chan within a few months.

On January 7, 2009, a year-old video from a strangely tantalizing teenager named [[Boxxy]] came to the full attention of /b/, which in turn incited a major civil war on /b/ between boxxy lovers and boxxy haters. Normal users, tired of both sides, took down the entire site in a major DDoS, forcing mods to ban all boxxy-related posts. Not long after, a group of namefags calling themselves the "Center for Boxxy Control and Restriction" (CBCR) hacked into Boxxy's account and held her IRL information hostage. Their work was undermined by their radical tendencies, and support eventually broke down. The scars of the civil war would not be forgotten for years, and Boxxy has, to this day retained her rightful place as the queen of /b/.

The Boxxy Era is characterized by the rise of [[Reddit]], a major content aggregator that rose to power after the [[Digg]] Revolt. Reddit's mainstream popularity and strong cultural influence from 4chan created a unique relationship between the two, 

## Payback Era (2010-2011)

After most anons forgot or gave up on Chanology, they returned to normal business on 4chan, which was still slowly growing in popularity. However, with the chilling news that Aiplex Software was DDoSing torrent sites for the MPAA, [[Anonymous]] came right out of dormancy to start a new age of hacktivism that grew to include [[Wikileaks]] and the [[Arab Spring]]. 4chan finally disowns Anonymous and it's related entities for good, and it is commonly accepted that Anonymous no longer lurks on 4chan.

## Prehistory

_Most of this comes from a tertiary source, a Redditor who restored the [[4chan History Timeline]] to the second [[Wikichan]]. Please correct any problems you see._

4chan may have been the most successful English anonymous discussion board, but it was neither the first nor the most popular.

Strong parallels to [[4chan]], [[7chan]], and [[Anonymous]] can be identified in [[Ayashii World]], [[2channel]], and Nanashi World.

### Ayashii World

Full Article: [[Ayashii World]]

In 1996, a man named Masayuki Shiba creates an anonymous BBS called [[Ayashii World]] (Strange/Suspicious World). Here, Warez and cp are commonly posted, and there is a gesu (scum) board where website hackings and invasions are discussed.

Inspired by it's revolutionary approach, many similar BBSes are formed, collectively called Nanashi Warudo (Nameless World). Like 4chan, these sites develop a culture based on memes, which became popular a while later. Ayashii World functioned as the hubsite of Nanashi World in a similar way to 4chan and Anonymous.

Ayashii World never had good servers, and shutdowns were commonplace for various reasons. After Masayuki Shiba received personal threats over the server issues, in 1998 he shut the site down for the last time.

### 2channel (2ch.net)

Full Article: [[2channel]]

Nanashi World moved off to [[Amezou]], the First Channel. At the time, it was merely a bunch of links to alternative BBSes, but soon becomes its own forum and introduces a new style of threaded message board, dependent on bumping and saging.

With a userbase larger than that of most cities, the First Channel was dead by 1999. An American college student named Hiroyuki Nishimura took up the challenge and created [[2channel]], the Second Channel. Using code based on the first, the site employed Californian high-traffic servers to handle the exponential growth.

2channel ended up becoming the longest running This was the text-based BBS featured in the film and TV series [[Densha Otoko]].

### Futaba Channel (2chan.net)

Full Article: [[Futaba Channel]]

By April 2001, [[2channel]] began to fall apart as data transformation bugs threatened to render the entire website unusable. Users began to warn of the coming apocalypse while volunteers from across Japan worked to find a solution.  

Just like before, multiple backup forums were created to house the refugees. Most were blatant copies of the textboard format, but one website called [[Futaba Channel]] (2chan.net) took it as a chance to experiment with a revolutionary idea: the Imageboard. 

With the textboards of the past, only experienced artists were able to make complicated Shift-JIS art, with images only linked. Now, any random lurker could simply download an image and post it as the topic of discussion. Anonymity combined with imageboards always leads to The site developed a unique culture all its own, growing out of the seeds brought by the 2channelers.

### world2ch

Full Article: [[world2ch]]

One of the backup forums made during the 2001 [[2channel]] crisis was called world2ch. This time, it's webmaster Taichirou Kosugi had a more ambitious goal: to create an English-language textboard where Japanese and American otakus could come together to speak in horribly broken English.

While the project became well-known on [[2channel]] itself, the anonymous textboard format never really appealed to Westerners, due to the general preference of vanity over content on conventional forums. Additionally westerners were used to the accounts and one-click smileys of conventional forums. Few saw the point of making time-consuming Shift-JIS art that was unable to viewed with the common ASCII encoding.

Still, the board was a groundbreaking first in the export of the 2channel-style anonymous BBS. Many later influential names started out or at least passed by this site, such as [[Shii]] and [[Moot]]. World2ch also took initiative to create the first English-language Imageboard.

But by 2006, World2ch ended merely as another failed copy of 2channel, with it's owner leaving the community for dead.

> I make a hobby and occasionally a living by being a digital archaeologist. [...] This whole 2ch business is more of digital anthropology. It's like I was wandering in some jungle of network cabling and there in the middle of it found a strange and totally alien tribe whose culture I can't begin to comprehend. That's why I'm here. Well, actually, here is more like the tourist version of 2ch. It's like a tacky roadside attraction complete with aluminum teepees where those passing through can just sort of fake living in the culture they've only seen at a distance… 

### Something Awful

Full Article: [[Something Awful]]

On the other side of the world, a conventional English forum called Something Awful (SA) was at it's greatest height. SA was the 4chan of it's day, presiding over a massive community who were mostly free to discuss the stranger stuff on the internet. It was also a major source of Internet culture in the early '00s, popularizing such lasting influences like the image macro, Numa Numa, and All Your Base (are belong to us).

We can sum it all up with their slogan; "The internet makes you stupid."

Some time between 18th April 2001 and 15th May 2001, SA added an anime board called [[ADTRW]] to separate the anime chat from the other boards. This forum quickly become connected to [[2channel]] and [[Futaba Channel]], and absorbed some parts of their culture.

Lowtax's later attempts to clean up the board, enforce heavy handed laws, and monetize the site causes a mass migration from the site. A few members of ADTRW started [[Raspberry Heaven]], an IRC channel that serves as the community maintained home of the ADTRW diaspora. 

### Raspberry Heaven

[[Raspberry Heaven]], a DC++ filesharing hub for anime, named for the ending theme to a 2002 series called Azumanga Daioh. Raspberry Heaven was itself a spinoff of SADCHUB, the Something Awful Direct Connect Hub, created to separate the anime from the serious business.

The Raspberry Heaven anime hub had a linked IRC channel, originally at the MircX network but later Pyoko IRC. Here, [[moot]] and several ADTRW
members were regulars. RH discovered [[Futaba Channel]] (2chan.net), a Japanese image board, and for a while the channel was full of 2chan image links. 2chan itself was conceived as a replacement for 2channel (2ch.net). This was the now unrelated text-based BBS featured in the film and TV series [[Densha Otoko]].

Sooner or later, Raspberry Heaven discovered [[Futaba Channel]] (2chan.net), a Japanese image board, and for a while the channel was full of 2chan image links.

## Genesis (2003 - 2004)

*Originally written on [Jonathan's Reference Pages](http://www.jonnydigital.com/).*

4chan was founded in 2003 by a kid from an IRC channel I visited at the time. It got popular purely by accident and when costs began to spiral
out of control we told him the site was doomed to failure. If I had known it one day become a dominant source of Internet culture with five
hundred million pageviews per month and an [Alexa Traffic Rank](http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/4chan.org) in the global top 1,000
websites, I might have written more of this down at the time.

4chan's original culture really goes back to a board called [[Something Awful]] (SA), a major source of Internet culture in the early '00s. Some time between 18th April 2001 and 15th May 2001, SA added an anime board called [[ADTRW]] to separate the anime chat from the other boards. Members of ADTRW started [[Raspberry Heaven]], a DC++ filesharing hub for anime, named for the ending theme to a 2002 series called Azumanga Daioh. Raspberry Heaven was itself a spinoff of SADCHUB, the Something Awful Direct Connect Hub, created to separate the anime from the serious business.

The Raspberry Heaven anime hub had a linked IRC channel, originally at the MircX network but later Pyoko IRC. Here, moot and several ADTRW
members were regulars. RH discovered [[Futaba Channel]] (2chan.net), a Japanese image board, and for a while the channel was full of 2chan image links. 2chan itself was conceived as a replacement for 2channel (2ch.net). This was the now unrelated text-based BBS featured in the film and TV series [[Densha Otoko]].

Sooner or later, Raspberry Heaven discovered [[Futaba Channel]] (2chan.net), a Japanese image board, and for a while the channel was full of 2chan image links.

At some point, 2chan blocked non-Japanese from posting. At the time we thought this was to keep out us English-posting gaijin devils, but I
think it later turned out they were blocking trolls from South Korea. [[moot]], at this point just an average hub member on Raspberry Heaven, registered the site's original domain, 4chan.net.

According to [Everything Shii Knows](http://shii.org/knows/4chan), moot registered 4chan.net on 29th September 2003. The first [news
post](http://www.4chan.org/news/?all) dates the site as opening two days later on 1st October. 

The foundation of 4chan fired up much of the English anonymous forum community, especially in [[world2ch]]. The archived thread [[here|dramabomb.txt]] gives a rare look into what was happening at the time.

RH went from full of 2chan links to full of 4chan
links. I remember pasting links in other channels, too. The ease of which a person could post content and share links like this was a major
factor in the success of 4chan, and other top websites later replicated this model: Youtube (video), Imageshack (long-term image storage), and
Rapidshare (files).

4chan drew many of its initial users from Raspberry Heaven and Something Awful's ADTRW board. Early 4chan thus inherited a lot of the Something
Awful humour and memes, like image macros. The original 4chan staff and moderators were drawn from ADTRW. The spinning head title image is an
Australian ADTRW member called Roobar. The "Dot net fo'shizzle!" title image is by ADTRW poster Rick\_Feynman, who coined the term "ZOMG!" (we
pronounce it "Zoh my god!") in an ICQ conversation with fellow SA goon Hannibal (see also this [2003 USENET
posting](http://groups.google.com/group/alt.sports.basketball.nba.boston-celtics/msg/b1c35ce7823fa799?pli=1));
although they admit the term was used before then, it wasn't widely used until popularized by Something Awful and 4chan.

moot later left Raspberry Heaven, as he was cool for us. Raspberry Heaven DC hub would close some years later as BitTorrent took over from
filesharing hubs and Pyoko IRC closed its doors.
