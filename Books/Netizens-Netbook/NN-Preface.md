## Preface

What is a Netizen?

The story of Netizens is an important one. In conducting 
research four years ago online to determine people's uses for the 
global computer communications network, I became aware that there 
was a new social institution, an electronic commons, developing. 
It was exciting to explore this new social institution. Others 
online shared this excitement. I discovered from those who wrote 
me that the people I was writing about were citizens of the Net, 
or Netizens.

I started using local bbses in Michigan in 1985. After seven 
years of participation on both local hobbiest-run computer 
bulletin boards systems, and global Usenet, I began to research 
Usenet and the Internet. I found these on-line discussions to be 
mentally invigorating and welcoming of thoughtful comments, 
questions and discussion. People were also friendly and 
considerate of others and their questions. This was a new 
environment for me. Little thoughtful conversation was encouraged 
in my high school. Since my daily life did not provide places and 
people to talk with about real issues and real world topics, I 
wondered why the online experience encouraged such discussions 
and consideration of others. Where did such a culture spring 
from, and how did it arise? During my sophomore year of college 
in 1992, I was curious to explore and better understand this new 
on-line world. 

As part of course work at Columbia University, I explored these 
questions. One professor's encouragement helped me to use Usenet and the 
Internet as places to conduct research. My research was real 
participation in the online community by exploring how and why these 
communications forums fuctioned. I posed questions on Usenet, mailing 
lists and freenets. Along with these questions, I would attach some 
worthwhile preliminary research. People respected my questions and found 
the preliminary research helpful. The entire process was one of mutual 
respect and sharing of research and ideas. A real notion of `community' 
and `participation' takes place. I found that on the Net people 
willingly help each other and work together to define and address 
issues important to them. These are often important issues which the 
conventional media would never cover.

My initial research concerned the origins and development of the 
global discussion forum Usenet. For my second paper, I wanted to explore 
the larger Net and what it was and its significance. This is when my 
research uncovered the remaining details that helped me to recognize the 
emergence of Netizens. There are people online who actively contribute 
towards the development of the Net. These people understand the 
value of collective work and the communal aspects of public 
communications. These are the people who discuss and debate topics in 
a constructive manner, who e-mail answers to people and provide 
help to new-comers, who maintain FAQ files and other public information 
repositories, who maintain mailing lists, and so on.  These are 
people who discuss the nature and role of this new communications 
medium. These are the people who as citizens of the Net, I 
realized were Netizens. However, these are not all people. 
Netizens are not just anyone who comes online, and they are 
especially not people who come online for individual gain or 
profit.  They are not people who come to the Net thinking it is a 
service. Rather they are people who understand it takes effort 
and action on each and everyone's part to make the Net a 
regenerative and vibrant community and resource. Netizens are 
people who decide to devote time and effort into making the Net, 
this new part of our world, a better place. Lurkers are not 
Netizens, and vanity home pages are not the work of Netizens. 
While lurking or trivial home pages do not harm the Net, they do 
not contribute either. 

The term Netizen has spread widely since it was first coined. The 
genesis comes from net culture based on the original newsgroup naming 
conventions. Network wide Usenet newsgroups included net.general for general 
discussion, net.auto for discussion of autos, net.bugs for discussion of 
unix bug reports, and so on. People who used Usenet would prefix terms 
related to the online world with the word NET similar to the newsgroup 
terminology. So there would be references to net.gods, net.cops or 
net.citizens. My research demonstrated that there were people active 
as members of the network, which the term net citizen does not precisely 
represent. The word citizen suggests a geographic or national definition 
of social membership. The word Netizen reflects the new non-
geographically based social membership. So I contracted the phrase 
net.citizen to Netizen. 

Two general uses of the term Netizen have developed. The first is a 
broad usage to refer to anyone who uses the Net, for whatever purpose. 
Thus, the term netizen has been prefixed in some uses with the adjectives 
good or bad. The second usage is closer to my understanding. This 
definition is used to describe people who care about Usenet and the 
bigger Net and work towards building the cooperative and collective 
nature which benefits the larger world. These are people who work towards 
developing the Net. In this second case, Netizen represents positive 
activity, and no adjective need be used. Both uses have spread from the 
online community, appearing in newspapers, magazines, television, books 
and other off-line media. As more and more people join the online 
community and contribute towards the nuturing of the Net and towards the 
development of a great shared social wealth, the ideas and values of 
Netizenship spread. But with the increasing commercialization and 
privitization of the Net, Netizenship is being challenged. During such a 
period it is valuable to look back at the pioneering vision and actions 
that have helped make the Net possible and examine what lessons they 
provide. That is what we have tried to do in these chapters.
