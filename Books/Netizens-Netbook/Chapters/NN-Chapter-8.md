### Preface

The creation of a Global Computer Network is one of the surprising
developments of our times. This achievement raises the question: What are
the factors that nourished the growth and development of this network and
what are those creating impediments to its continued development and
expansion?(1)

### Introduction

J.C.R. Licklider was one of the early computer pioneers who helped
to make the global computer network a reality. His vision of an
Intergalactic Computer Network helped to inspire these developments. He
and Albert Vezza, describing an earlier networking advance, wrote,
"Shakespeare could have been foreseeing the present situation in
information networking when he said, `... What's past is prologue; what's
to come, in yours and my discharge'."(2) The story of the network's
growth and development contains important lessons for its continued
expansion. The development of this international network, linking
millions of people around the world, now stands at a turning point. Will
it continue to go forward or will it be detoured? An understanding of the
environment and policies that nourished the development of the global
computer network provides a foundation on which to base its further
expansion. Such an understanding will also make it possible to contribute
to the cooperative networking culture that has evolved and flourished
through these policies.

### The Development of the ARPANET

In 1962, the report "On Distributed Communications Networks"
by Paul Baran, was published by the Rand Corporation.(3) Baran's
research, funded under a standing contract from the U.S. Air Force,
discussed how the U.S. military could protect its communications
systems from serious attack. Baran outlined the principle of
"redundancy of connectivity" and explored various models of forming
communications systems and evaluating their vulnerability. The report
proposed a communications system where there would be no obvious central
command and control point, but all surviving points would be able to
reestablish contact in the event of an attack on any one point. Thus
damage to a part would not destroy the whole and its effect on the whole
would be minimized.

One of his recommendations was for a national public utility to
transport computer data, much in the way the telephone system transports
voice data. "Is it time now to start thinking about a new and possibly
non-existent public utility," Baran asked, "a common user digital data
communication plant designed specifically for the transmission of digital
data among a large set of subscribers?"(4) He cautioned against limiting
the choice of technology to create such a network to that which was
currently in use. He proposed that a packet switching, store and forward
technology be developed for a data network. The 11 reports he wrote were
the first published description of what we now call packet switching.(5)
Another networking pioneer, Donald W. Davies, of the United Kingdom, also
did important work in this field and has been credited with introducing
the term "packet" switching.

Other researchers were interested in computers and communications,
particularly in the computer as a communication device. J.C.R. Licklider
was one of the most influential. He was particularly interested in the
man-computer communication relationship. "Lick", as he asked people to
call him, wondered how the computer could help humans to think and to
solve problems. In the article, "Man Computer Symbiosis", he explored how
the computer could help humans to do intellectual work. Licklider was
also interested in the question of how the computer could help humans to
communicate better.(6) In another article, "The Computer as
Communications Device," Licklider and his co-author Robert Taylor wrote,
"In a few years men will be able to communicate more effectively through
a machine than face to face...When minds interact, new ideas emerge."(7)

What pioneers like Paul Baran and J.C.R. Licklider were proposing was
the development of computer technology in a direction that had not been
developed before. Larry Roberts, also a pioneer during these important
early days of networking, points out that Baran's work was either
classified or otherwise "unfortunately...very sparsely published in
the scientific press."(8) Thus according to Roberts, the impact of
Baran's work on the actual development of packet switching networks
"was mainly supportative, not sparking its development." Licklider,
however, had access to military research and writing, but he was
also involved in the academic computer science research and education
community.(9) Roberts describes how he was influenced by Licklider's
vision of an Intergalactic Computer Network to change his life and
career. Licklider's concept of an Intergalactic Computer Network, Roberts
explains, represented the effort to "define the problems and benefits
resulting from computer networking."(10)

After informal conversations with three important computer science
pioneers, J.C.R. Licklider, Fernando Corbato and Alan Perlis, at the
Second Congress on Information System Sciences in Hot Springs, Virginia,
in November 1964, Larry Roberts "concluded that the most important
problem in the computer field before us at the time was computer
networking; the ability to access one computer from another easily and
economically to permit resource sharing." Roberts recalled, "That was a
topic in which Licklider was very interested and his enthusiasm infected
me."(11)

During the early 1960s, the DOD under ARPA established two new
funding offices, the IPTO and another for behavioral science. From 1962-
64, Licklider took a leave from BBN in Cambridge, Massachusetts to give
guidance to these two newly created offices. In reviewing this seminal
period, Alan Perlis recalled how Licklider's philosophy guided ARPA's
funding of computer science research. Perlis explained, "I think that we
all should be grateful to ARPA for not focusing on very specific projects
such as workstations. There was no order issued that said, `We want a
proposal on a workstation.' Goodness knows, they would have gotten many
of them. Instead, I think that ARPA, through Lick, realized that if you
get `n' good people together to do research on computing, you're going to
illuminate some reasonable fraction of the ways of proceeding because the
computer is such a general instrument." In retrospect Perlis concluded,
"We owe a great deal to ARPA for not circumscribing directions that
people took in those days. I like to believe that the purpose of the
military is to support ARPA, and the purpose of ARPA is to support
research."(12)

Licklider was guided in his philosophy by the rationale that a broad
investigation of a problem was necessary in order to solve the problem.
"There's a lot of reason for adopting a broad delimitation rather than a
narrow one," he explained, "because if you're trying to find out where
ideas come from, you don't want to isolate yourself from the areas that
they come from."(13) And he succeeded in attracting others involved in
computer research to his vision that computer networking was the most
important challenge of the times.

In 1966-67, MIT's Lincoln Laboratory in Lexington, Massachusetts
and System Development Corp. (SDC), in Santa Monica, California, got a
grant from the U.S. Department of Defense to begin research on linking
computers across the continent. Describing this work, Roberts explained,
"Convinced that it was a worthwhile goal, we set up a test network to see
where the problems would be. Since computer time sharing experiments at
MIT [CTSS] and at Dartmouth [DTSS] had demonstrated that it was possible
to link different computer users to a single computer, the cross country
experiment built on this advance." (i.e. once timesharing was possible,
the linking of remote computers became feasible.)(14)

Roberts reported that there was no trouble linking dissimilar
computers (the TX-2 computer at Lincoln Laboratory in Massachusetts
and the Q-32 computer at SDC in California). The problem, he claimed,
was with using telephone circuit switching technology because the
throughput was inadequate to accomplish their goals. Thus their
experiment set the basis for justifying research in setting up a
nationwide store and forward, packet switching data network.

During this period, ARPA was funding computer research at several
U.S. universities and research laboratories. The decision was made
to include these research contractors in an experimental network,
eventually called the ARPANET. A plan was created for a working network
to link 16 research groups together. This plan for the ARPANET was made
available at the October 1967 ACM Symposium on Operating Principles in
Gatlinburg, Tennessee.(15) The planned research was to be encouraged and
funded by the IPTO. Roberts was recruited to head the IPTO and guide the
research. A Request for Proposal (RFP) set out specifications for the
project and asked for bids. Proposals were invited to create an
operational network at four sites and to provide a design for a network
that could include 16 sites.

The award for the contract went to BBN in January, 1969. The planned
network would make use of mini-computers to serve as switching nodes for
the host computers at four sites that were to be connected to the
network. The Honeywell DDP-516 minicomputers were chosen for the network
of interface message processors (IMPs) that would be linked to each
other. At first, each of the IMPs (i.e. nodes) would be linked to one
host computer. These IMPs were configured with 12,000 16-bit words of
memory though they were among the most powerful minicomputers available
at the time.

The opening stanzas of a poem by Vint Cerf, an ARPANET
pioneer, describe computer science research before and after the
ARPANET.

> Like distant islands sundered by the sea,
> We had no sense of one community.
> We lived and worked apart and rarely knew
> That others searched with us for knowledge, too.
> 
> Distant ARPA spurred us in our quest
> And for our part we worked and put to test
> New thoughts and theories of computing art;
> We deemed it science not, but made a start.
> 
> Each time a new machine was built and sold,
> We'd add it to our list of needs and told
> Our source of funds "Alas! Our knowledge loom
> Will halt 'til it's in our computer room.
> 
> ....
> 
> But, could these new resources not be shared?
> Let links be built; machines and men be paired!
> Let distance be no barrier! They set
> That goal: design and build the ARPANET!(16)

On August 30, 1969, the first IMP arrived at the University of
California, Los Angeles (UCLA) which was to be the first site of the new
network. It was connected to the SDS Sigma 7 computer at UCLA using the
GENIE operating system. Shortly thereafter IMPs were delivered to the
other three sites in this initial testbed network. At Stanford Research
Institute (SRI), the IMP was connected to an SDS-940 computer using the
SEX operating system. At the University of California, Santa Barbara
(UCSB), the IMP was connected to an IBM 360/75 using OS/MVT. And at the
University of Utah (Utah), the fourth site, the IMP was connected to a
DEC PDP-10 using the TENEX operating system.

By the end of 1969, the first four IMPs had been connected to the
host computers at their individual sites and the network connections
between the IMPs were operational. The researchers and scientists
involved could begin to identify the problems they had to solve to
develop a working network where there would be communication from
host to host.

There were programming and other technical problems to be solved so
the different computers would be able to communicate with each other.
Also, there was a need for an agreed upon set of signals that would
open up communication channels, allow data to pass through, and then
close the channels. These agreed upon standards were called
protocols. The initial proposal for the ARPANET required that the
sites work together to establish the necessary protocols. Beginning
in 1968, meetings of a group to discuss establishing these protocols
took place.(17) In 1969, the group which called itself the Network
Working Group (NWG) began to put together a set of documents that
would be available to everyone involved for consideration and
discussion. They called these documents Requests For Comment (RFC)
and RFC 1, dated April, 1969, was mailed to the participants.(18)

As the problems of setting up the four computer network were
identified and solved, the network was expanded to several more
sites.(19) By April 1971, there were 15 nodes and 23 hosts in the
network. The earliest sites attached to the network were connected
to Honeywell DDP-516 IMPs.(20)

These sites were:

1. UCLA
2. SRI
3. UCSB
4. U. of UTAH
5. BBN
6. MIT
7. RAND Corp
8. SDC
9. Harvard
10. Lincoln Lab
11. Stanford
12. U. of Illinois, Urbana
13. Case Western Reserve U.
14. Carnegie Mellon U. (CMU)
15. NASA-AMES

Then a smaller minicomputer, the Honeywell 316, was utilized. It
was compatible with the DDP-516 IMP but was available at half the
cost. Some nodes were configured using these smaller minicomputers as
TIPs (i.e., Terminal IMPs) beginning with NASA-AMES TIP and MITRE TIP.

By January 1973, there were 35 nodes of which 14 were TIPs
including a satellite link which connected California with a TIP in
Hawaii.

With the rapid increase of network traffic, problems were
discovered with the reliability of the subnet and corrections had to
be worked on. In mid 1973, Norway and England were added to the Net
by a low speed line, adding to the problems to be solved. By
September 1973, there were 40 nodes and 45 hosts on the network. And
the traffic had expanded from 1 million packets per day in 1972 to
2.9 million packets per day by September, 1973.

By 1977, there were 111 host computers connected via the ARPANET.
By 1983 there were 4,000.(21)

As the network was put into operation, the researchers learned
which of their original assumptions and models were sound and which
were inaccurate. For example, BBN describes how they had initially
failed to understand that the IMPs would need to do error checking
of the IMP/host interface. They explain:

> "The first four IMPs were developed and installed on schedule by
> the end of 1969. No sooner were these IMPs in the field than it
> became clear that some provision was needed to connect hosts
> relatively distant from an IMP (i.e., up to 2,000 feet instead of
> the expected 50 feet). Thus, in early 1970 a `distant' IMP/host
> interface was developed. Augmented simply by heftier line drivers,
> these distant interfaces made clear, for the first time, the fallacy
> in the assumption that had been made that no error control was
> needed on the host/IMP interface because there would be no errors on
> such a local connection."(22)

The expanding operational network made it possible to uncover the
actual bugs and make the needed corrections. In describing the
importance of an operational network to the research efforts,
as opposed to being limited to a laboratory model, Alex McKenzie
and David Walden, in their article "ARPANET, the Defense Data
Network, and Internet" write:

> "Errors in coding control were another problem. However carefully one
> designs, codes, and performs quality control, errors can still slip
> through. Fortunately, with a large number of IMPs in the network, most
> of these errors are found quickly because they occur so frequently. For
> instance, a bug in an IMP code that occurs once a day in one IMP,
> occurs every 15 min in a 100-IMP network. Unfortunately, some bugs
> still will remain. If a symptom of a bug is detected somewhere in a
> 100-IMP network once a week (often enough to be a problem), then it
> will happen only once every 2 years in a single IMP in a development
> lab for a programmer trying to find the source of the symptom. Thus,
> achieving a totally bug-free network is very difficult."(23)

In October 1972, the First International Conference on Computer
Communications was held in Washington, D.C. A public demonstration
of the ARPANET was given, setting up an actual node with 40
terminals. Representatives from projects around the world including
Canada, France, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Great Britain and the U.S.
discussed the need to begin work establishing agreed upon
protocols. The InterNetwork Working Group (INWG) was created to
begin discussions for a common protocol and Vinton Cerf, who was
involved with UCLA ARPANET, was chosen as the first chairman. The
vision proposed for the international interconnection of networks
was "a mesh of independent, autonomous networks interconnected by
gateways, just as independent circuits of ARPANET are interconnected
by IMPs."(24)

The network continued to grow and expand.

In 1975, the ARPANET was transferred to the control of the
Defense Communications Agency (DCA).

Evaluating the success of ARPANET research, Licklider recalled
that he felt ARPA had been run by an enlightened set of military men
while he was involved with it. "I don't want to brag about ARPA," he
explained, "It is in my view, however, a very enlightened place. It
was fun to work there. I think I never encountered brighter, more
creative people, than the inhabitants of the third floor E-ring of
the Pentagon. But that, I'll say, was a long time ago, and I simply
don't know how bright and likeable they are now. But ARPA didn't
constrain me much."(25)

The following description of his experience on the early
ARPANET, was posted on Usenet by Eugene Miya, who had been a
student at one of the early ARPA sites. His experience documents
the encouraging research environment of the early ARPANET. He wrote:

He continued:

Miya's account, describing the stimulating research
environment created via the ARPANET, documents how this
environment not only helped to create a global computer network,
but also led to the creation of new networking applications. For
example, one of the surprising developments to the researchers of
the ARPANET was the great popularity of electronic mail.
Analyzing the reasons for this unanticipated benefit from their
ARPANET research, Licklider and Vezza wrote:

> "By the fall of 1973, the great effectiveness and convenience of
> such fast, informed messages services... had been discovered by
> almost everyone who had worked on the development of the ARPANET --
> and especially by the then Director of ARPA, S.J. Lukasik, who soon
> had most of his office directors and program managers communicating
> with him and with their colleagues and their contractors via the
> network. Thereafter, both the number of (intercommunicating)
> electronic mail systems and the number of users of them on the
> ARPANET increased rapidly."(27)

They describe the advantages of email explaining "that, in an
ARPANET message, one could write tersely and type imperfectly, even to an
older person in a superior position and even to a person one did not know
very well, and the recipient took no offense." there was none of the
formality and perfection that were required in a typed letter. They
reasoned that perhaps this was "because the network was so much faster,
so much more like the telephone.... Among the advantages of the
network message services over the telephone were the fact that one
could proceed immediately to the point without having to engage in
small talk first, that the message services produced a preservable
record, and that the sender and receiver did not have to be
available at the same time."(28)

Concurring about the importance of the development of e-mail, the
authors of The Completion Report (1978) wrote: "The largest single
surprise of the ARPANET program has been the incredible popularity and
success of network mail. There is little doubt that the techniques of
network mail developed in connection with the ARPANET program are going
to sweep the country and drastically change the techniques used for
intercommunication in the public and private sectors."(29)

Not only did the ARPANET make it possible to learn what the actual
problems of networking would be, the communication it made possible
gave the researchers the ability to collaborate to solve the problems.

Summarizing the important breakthrough this technology represented,
the authors of "The Completion Report" wrote(30):

> "This ARPA program has created no less than a revolution in computer
> technology and has been one of the most successful projects ever
> undertaken by ARPA. The program has initiated extensive changes in
> the Defense Department's use of computers as well as in the use of
> computers by the entire public and private sectors, both in the
> United States and around the world."

> "Just as the telephone, the telegraph, and the printing press had
> far-reaching effects on human intercommunication," they noted, "the
> widespread utilization of computer networks which has been catalyzed
> by the ARPANET project represents a similarly far-reaching change
> in the use of computers by mankind."

"The full impact of the technical changes set in motion by this
project may not be understood for many years," they appropriately
concluded.

projects and their computers provided an ideal environment for an
experimental network project; consequently the ARPANET was planned
during 1967 with the aid of these researchers to link these
project's computers together. One task was to develop a computer
interface protocol acceptable to all 16 research groups. A second
task was to design a new communications technology to support 35
computers at 16 sites with 500,000 packets/day traffic. The initial
plan for the ARPANET was published in October 1967 at the ACM
Symposium on Operating System Principles in Gatlinburg Tennessee."
(pp. 145-146) Also, Roberts describes the network design for the
ARPANET. He writes, "The communications network design was that of

(IMPs) at each node interconnected by leased telecommunication lines
providing a store and forward service on very short messages." (p.
