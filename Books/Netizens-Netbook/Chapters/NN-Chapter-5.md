What is the reality behind all the talk about the so called 
"Information Superhighway"? This is an important question which 
U.S. government policy makers seem to be ignoring. However, 
understanding the history of the current global computer networks is 
a crucial step towards building the network of the future. There is
a vision that guided the origin and development of the Internet, 
Usenet and other associated physical and logical networks. What is 
that vision?

While the global computer networks are basically young -- the 
ARPANET started in 1969 -- their 25 plus years of growth has been 
substantial. The ARPANET was the experimental network connecting 
the mainframe computers of universities and other contractors funded 
and encouraged by the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the 
U.S. Department of Defense. The ARPANET started out as a research test 
bed for computer networking, communication protocols, computer and data 
resource sharing, etc. However, what it developed into was something 
surprising. The widest use of the ARPANET was for computer facilitated 
human-human communication using electronic mail (e-mail) and discussion 
lists. (Popular lists included Human-Nets, Wine-Tasters and Sci-Fi Lovers 
lists.) The human communications achievements of ARPANET research 
continue to be today's most popular usage of the Net by a growing number 
and variety of people through e-mail, Usenet discussion groups, mailing 
lists, internet relay chat, and so on. The ARPANET was the product of 
previous U.S. government funded research in interactive computing and 
time-sharing of computers.

Until the 1960s, computers operated almost exclusively in batch 
mode. Programmers punched or had their programs punched onto cards. Then 
the stack of punched cards was provided to the local computer center. The 
computer operator assembled stacks of cards into batches to be feed to 
the computer for continuous processing. Often a programmer had to wait 
over a day in order to see the results from his or her input. In 
addition, if there were any mistakes in the creation of the punched 
cards, the stack or part of it had to be punched again and resubmitted, 
which would take another day. Bugs in the code could only be discovered 
after an attempt to compile the code and therefore "debugging" was a slow 
process. This batch processing mode was a very inefficient way of 
utilizing the power of the computer. People began thinking of ways to 
alter the interface between people and computers. The idea of time-
sharing developed among some in computer research communities. Time-
sharing makes it possible for people to utilize a computer (then 
predominately the IBM mainframe) simultaneously. Time-sharing operates by 
giving the impression that the each user is the only one using the 
computer. This is executed by having the computer divvy out slices of CPU 
time to all the users in a rapid, sequential manner.

Crucial to the development of today's global computer networks was 
the vision of researchers interested in time-sharing. These researchers 
began to think about social issues related to time-sharing. 
They observed the communities that formed from the people who used 
time-sharing systems and considered the social significance of these 
communities. Two of the pioneers involved in research in time-sharing at 
MIT, Fernando Corbato and Robert Fano, wrote, "The time-sharing computer 
system can unite a group of investigators in a cooperative search for the 
solution to a common problem, or it can serve as a community pool
of knowledge and skill on which anyone can draw according to his
needs. Projecting the concept on a large scale, one can conceive of
such a facility as an extraordinarily powerful library serving an
entire community in short, an intellectual public utility."(1)

Research in time-sharing started in the early 1960s around the 
country at different research centers. Some examples were CTSS 
(Compatible Time-sharing System) at MIT, DTSS (Dartmouth Time-sharing 
System) at Dartmouth, a system at BBN, Project GENIE at the University of 
California at Berkeley, and so on. J.C.R. Licklider, the founding director 
of ARPA's Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) thought of 
time-sharing as interactive computing. Interactive computing meant the 
user could communicate and respond to the computer's responses in a way 
that batch processing did not allow.

Licklider was one of the first users of the new time-sharing
systems, and took the time to play around with them. Examining
the uses of this new way of communicating with the computer
enabled Licklider to think about the future possibilities. This was
helpful because Licklider went on to establish the priorities and
direction for ARPA's IPTO research monies. Many of the interviewees in 
a series of interviews conducted by the Charles Babbage Institute (CBI) 
said that ARPA's money was given in those days under Licklider's guidance 
to seed research which would be helpful to society in general and only 
secondarily helpful to the military.

Both Robert Taylor and Larry Roberts, future successors of
Licklider as director of IPTO, pinpoint Licklider as the originator
of the vision which set ARPA's priorities and goals and basically
drove ARPA to help develop the concept and practice of networking 
computers.

In one of the CBI interviews, Roberts said: "what I concluded was 
that we had to do something about communications, and that really, the 
idea of the galactic network that Lick talked about, probably more than
anybody, was something that we had to start seriously thinking
about. So in a way networking grew out of Lick's talking about that,
although Lick himself could not make anything happen because it
was too early when he talked about it. But he did convince me it was 
important."(2)

Taylor, also in a CBI conducted interview, pointed out the 
importance of Licklider's vision to future network development, "I
don't think anyone who's been in that DARPA position since
[Licklider] has had the vision that Licklider had. His being at that
place at that time is a testament to the tenuousness of it all. It was
really a fortunate circumstance. I think most of the significant
advances in computer technology, especially in the systems part
of computer science were simply extrapolations of Licklider's
vision. They were not really new visions of their own. So he's really
the father of it all."(3)

Taylor also described how research in time-sharing led to 
surprising results. He succeeded Licklider as Director of the IPTO at 
ARPA. A phrase that J.C.R. Licklider frequently used to express his 
vision was "an Intergalactic Network." Taylor explains that Licklider 
used this phrase to describe the potential community that he realized 
would emerge from the interconnection of the local communities of Net 
users that develop from time-sharing. At first, Taylor notes ARPA 
supported research had as its goal achieving compatibility and resource 
sharing across different computer systems. However, he explains,

> "They were just talking about a network where they could have a 
> compatibility across these systems, and at least do some load 
> sharing, and some program sharing, data sharing that sort of thing. 
> Whereas, the thing that struck me about the time-sharing experience 
> was that before there was a time-sharing system, let's say at MIT, 
> then there were a lot of individual people who didn't know each 
> other who were interested in computing in one way or another, and 
> who were doing whatever they could, however they could. As soon as 
> the time-sharing system became usable, these people began to know 
> one another, share a lot of information, and ask of one another, 
> 'How do I use this? Where do I find that?' It was really phenomenal 
> to see this computer become a medium that stimulated the formation 
> of a human community. And so, here ARPA had a number of sites by 
> this time, each of which had its own sense of community and was 
> digitally isolated from the other one. I saw a phrase in the 
> Licklider memo. The phrase was in a totally different context 
> something that he referred to as an 'intergalactic network.' I asked 
> him about this ... in fact I said, 'Did you have a networking of the 
> ARPANET sort in mind when you used that phrase?' He said, 'No, I was 
> thinking about a single time-sharing system that was intergalactic 
> '"(4)

As Taylor explains, the users of the time-sharing systems would 
form, usually unexpectedly, a new community. People were connected to 
others who were also interested in these new computing systems.

The vision driving ARPA inspired bright researchers working
on computer related topics. Roberts explains that Licklider's work
(and that of the IPTO's directors after him) educated people who
were to become the future leaders in the computer industry. 
Roberts describes the impact that Licklider and his vision made on
ARPA and future IPTO directors: "Well, I think that the one
influence is the production of people in the computer field that
are trained, and knowledgeable, and capable, and that form the
basis for the progress the United States has made in the computer
field. That production of people started with Lick, when he started
the IPTO program and started the big university programs. It was
really due to Lick, in large part, because I think it was that early
set of activities that I continued with that produced the most people
with the big university contracts. That produced a base for them to
expand their whole department, and produced excitement in the
university"(5)

Roberts describes how ARPA supported university research had a 
significant impact on the computer industry as well. "So it was clear 
that that was a big impact on the universities and therefore, in the 
industry. You can almost track all those people and see what effect that 
has had. The people from those projects are in large part the leaders 
throughout the industry"(6)

Licklider's vision was of an "Intergalactic Network," a time-sharing 
utility that would serve the entire galaxy. This early vision of 
time-sharing spawned the idea of interconnecting different time-sharing
systems by networking them together. This network would allow
those on geographically separated time-sharing systems to share
data, programs, research, and later other ideas and anything that
could be typed out. In the article,  "The Computer as a 
Communications Device", Licklider and Taylor predicted the 
creation of a global computer network. They wrote: "We have seen 
the beginnings of communication through a computer -- communication 
among people at consoles located in the same room or on the same 
university campus or even at distantly separated laboratories of 
the same research and development organization. This kind of 
communication -- through a single multiaccess computer with the 
aid of telephone lines -- is beginning to foster cooperation and 
promote coherence more effectively than do present arrangements 
for sharing computer programs by exchanging magnetic tape by 
messenger or mail."(7)

They point out how the interconnection of computers leads to a much 
broader class of connections than might have been expected. A new form of 
community is generated. "The collection of people, hardware, and software 
the multiaccess computer together with its local community of users will 
become a node in a geographically distributed computer network. Let us
assume for a moment that such a network has been formed. Through
the network of message processors, therefore, all the large
computers can communicate with one another. And through them,
all the members of the super community can communicate with
other people, with programs, with data, or with a selected
combinations of those resources."(8)

Licklider and Taylor consider more than just hardware and software 
when they write about the new social dynamics that the connections of 
dispersed computers and people will create. They explain: "[These 
communities] will be communities not of common location, but of common 
interest. In each field, the overall community of interest will be large 
enough to support a comprehensive system of field-oriented programs and
data."(9)

In exploring this community of common affinity, they describe the 
main advantages that come from connecting to and being part of these new 
computer facilitated communities. Life will be enriched for those people 
who can communicate on-line with others who have similar goals and 
interests, as they won't be limited by geography. Communication will be 
more productive and thus more enjoyable. And the kind of programs that 
those on-line will have access to will be customized to one's interests 
and abilities, and thus more satisfying. And they describe the advantages 
to society that the increased opportunities and resources made possible 
by the Net can provide for everyone.(10)

Since the advantages that computer networks make possible for 
society will only happen if these advantages are available to all who 
want to make use of them, Licklider and Taylor realize there is a crucial 
challenge put on the agenda of our times by the development of the Net. 
They conclude their article with a prophetic question: "Will `to be on 
line' be a privilege or a right?"(11) They argue that it must be a right. 
Otherwise, instead of providing all the many benefits it makes possible, 
it will only increase the inequities of intellectual opportunity that 
currently exist.  

The challenge they raise is one of access. The authors point out 
that the positive effects of computer networking will only come about if 
the networks are made easy to use and available to all. They argue that 
access should be made available because of the global benefits that would 
ensue. They conclude by describing how humankind can benefit immeasurably 
from the educational opportunities the Net makes possible, "if the 
network idea should prove to do for education what a few have envisioned 
in hope...surely the boon to humankind would be beyond measure."(12)

Licklider and Taylor raise the important point that access should be 
made available to all who want to use the computer networks. Therefore it 
is important to ask if the National Information Infrastructure is being 
designed with the principle of equality of access. The vision of the 
interconnection and interaction of diverse communities guided the 
creation of the original ARPANET. In the design of the expansion of the 
Net, it is important to keep the original vision in mind to consider if 
the vision was correct, or if it was just important in the initial 
development of networking technologies and techniques. However, very 
little emphasis has been placed on either the study of Licklider's vision 
or the role and advantages of the Net up to this point. In addition, the 
public has not been allowed to play a role in the planning process for 
the new initiatives which the U.S. government is currently undertaking. 
This is a plea to you to demand more of a part in the development of the 
future of the Net.
