## CHAPTER 4: The World of Usenet

During the past several decades there have been important
technological breakthroughs. The personal computer, a science
fiction dream for generations, is now available as a household
appliance in a way that the typewriter or tv were just a few
years ago. Also, a public conferencing network called Usenet
transported via physical networks like the Internet, UUCP, and
others, encourages public discussion and the free exchange of
ideas on a world wide scale.

Usenet is a world wide public conferencing network that makes it
possible for computer users around the world to have public discussions,
raise questions or problems so they can get help, or send e-mail to each
other often instanteously. One user explains that it is like a newspaper
where "everyone's letter to the editor is printed."(1) Usenet has also
been described as a series of electronic magazines. "These magazines,"
called `newsgroups,' are devoted to particular topics, ranging from
questions about UNIX, programming languages, and computer systems to
discussions of politics, philosophy, science, and recreational
activities."(2) Usenet has been compared to an electronic town meeting of
the world or to a series of electronic soap boxes. Others have observed
that "It's now as if everyone owns a printing press" or even better "a
publishing house."

Computer users with access to Usenet can read articles on a broad
range of topics. They can contribute their responses or post articles of
their own on any subject in an appropriate newsgroup. Their submissions
are then copied electronically to computers around the world which are
also part of the Usenet network. Usenet demonstrates what happens when
people are encouraged and allowed to develop computer technology.

An important element, according to Gregory G. Woodbury, who has
written an account of the early days of Usenet, is that the Usenet
software was created under the conditions of the academic Unix license
which then provided that the program be put into the public domain. And
since everyone involved at the time was working in an academic
environment (including Bell Labs which Woodbury notes was "academic
really") where information was shared, the emphasis was on communication,
not on copyright or other proprietary rights. "Everyone wanted to be on
the Net," he notes, "and it was clear they were cooperating in doing
so."(3)

The phenomenal growth of Usenet during the early 1980's
was an acknowledgment that it was a superior means of dealing
with the growing mailing lists on various subjects that had
developed on the early ARPAnet network. The original script files
had been rewritten in C by Steve Bellovin for use at "unc" and
"duke", according to Gene Spafford's history of the period.
Stephen Daniel, Spafford explains, "did another implementation in
C for public distribution."(4) After Tom Truscott made
modifications in this program, the software became known as the A
News release of Netnews.

"Under the strain of being an international network," Woodbury
explains, "with several new machines being added daily, certain
limitations in the basic assumptions made themselves painfully obvious."
The continuing expansion led to a rewriting of the software in 1981 by
Mark Horton, a graduate student at the University of California at
Berkeley, and Matt Glickman, a high school student. This version was
released to the public as B News, version 2.1 in 1982. Then in 1985, the
still ever expanding nature of Usenet led Henry Spencer and Geoff Collyer
at the University of Toronto to set to work on what is now known as C
News which they released in 1989. Spencer and Collyer paid very careful
attention to the performance aspects of C News. The result is that the
software was able to handle the phenomenal expansion of Usenet.(5) A
subsequent version of the Netnews software known as INN was created and
used to transport Usenet.

The administration and coordination of this world wide network
depends to a great extent on the cooperation and diligent work of
the system administrators at the participating sites. In the
early development of Usenet, some of these administrators
knew each other and worked together to establish a series of
general procedures for processes like adding newsgroups. Known as
the "backbone cabal", this group worked together to hash out ways
to deal with problems that threatened the voluntary, cooperative
nature of the Net.

Those who were part of this informal structure would contact
new site administrators who joined the Net. The character of the
Net as a voluntary association of people who posted because they
wanted to communicate was conveyed. And the fact that posts were
entered into the "public domain" was established as an essential
principle of the Net.(6)

Usenet is now made up of thousands of newsgroups organized around
different topics. The number of groups is constantly growing as there is
a procedure established to provide for new groups. If 100 more users vote
for a new group than vote against it, the group can be started.(7) This
procedure governs new groups in what is known as the "Seven Sisters"
hierarchy, which was the collection of the seven newsgroups at one point
known as Usenet. Some people have defined Usenet as those sites receiving
the seven main groups; comp, misc, news, rec, sci, soc, and talk
newsgroups, and the group news.announce.important. Others have defined
Usenet as those sites that receive at least one of the newsgroups that
appears on the list of Usenet newsgroups. There are also alternate
hierarchies which includes alt, gnu, bit and others. A more informal
procedure is used for creating for example an alt newsgroup than that
used to create a newsgroup in one of the "Seven Sisters" hierarchies. The
guidelines provide for posting a proposal or charter for the new
newsgroup to the alt.config newsgroup. The proposal is discussed and then
the newsgroup can be set up as an alt group when a new newsgroup control
message is posted to the control newsgroup.

Many of the people using and contributing to Usenet are people who
work with computer technology. Many of these people have a need for
Usenet to help with problems they encounter with computer technology. One
of the early functions of Usenet was to help identify bugs in new
technology and to identify and propagate ways to deal with such
problems.(8)

My experience using Usenet has been inspiring. I was
interested in discussions involving economics and the history of
economic thought. When I first got onto Usenet, I couldn't figure
out where such discussions would take place. I managed to get
access to the misc.books.technical newsgroup. I didn't know what
the other newsgroups were or how to find out. Not knowing how to
proceed I entered the following post:

    From: au329@cleveland.Freenet.Edu (Ronda Hauben)
    Newsgroups: misc.books.technical
    Date: 10 Jan 92 07:48:58 GMT
    Organization: Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland,
    Ohio, (USA)
    Nntp-Posting-Host: cwns9.ins.cwru.edu

    I am interested in discussing the history of economics -- i.e.
    mercantilists, physiocrats, adam smith, ricardo, marx, marshall,
    keynes etc. With the world in such a turmoil it would seem that
    the science of economics needs to be reinvigorated.

    Is there anyplace on Usenet News where this kind of discussion
    is taking place? If not is there anyone else interested in
    starting a conference .economics and how would I go about doing
    this. This is my first time on Usenet News.

    Ronda
    au329@cleveland.freenet.edu

One of the many responses I received said:

    "Start discussing on sci.econ. We're all ears."(9)

I received several other responses via e-mail also pointing me
to the sci.econ newsgroup or indicating interest in the topic.
Also, a computer user from California sent me e-mail with a list
of all the newsgroups that existed. Another user from Scotland
wrote telling me the name of the news file which listed the names
of all of the other newsgroups. It is considered good NETIQUETTE
(i.e. Network Etiquette) to help new users and many of the
experienced users are very willing to do so.

A few users suggested that I might want to try to start a
newsgroup for the history of economics, but that it would
probably be a wise idea to either wait awhile until I got used to
Netnews before trying to initiate a group, or suggesting I try to
get a user with more experience to help.

The list of newsgroups posted on Usenet in newsgroups like
news.misc contains descriptions of each group. For example, the
newsgroup "sci.econ" is described as "the science of economics."

I have found the discussions in sci.econ very valuable. There are
often debates over important economic questions. Many of the questions
discussed concern broad social issues -- for example, the development of
different social forms of society, whether economics is a science,
whether the so called "free market" has ever existed to regulate
production, etc. There has been discussion of a variety of economic and
political issues - like social security, rent control, strikes in
Germany, national health care reform, the need for shorter hours of work,
plant closures, taxes, the economic programs of presidential candidates,
the role of markets in setting prices, the economic program of Henry
George, etc.

Many newsgroups on Usenet are related to computers and
computer subjects. There are newsgroups where one can ask
questions regarding access to Usenet or about books that are
recommended for people who want to learn more about Unix or any
other area of computer usage, etc. It is also possible to write
to someone who has posted a question and ask them to forward a
copy or summary of the responses they receive so the post doesn't
have to be duplicated. There are also newsgroups dealing with
political issues, social issues, current events, hobbies,
science, education, etc.

When a critique of GM plant closures was posted after
GM announced that it would lay off 70,000 people, several
people sent e-mail saying that it was good to see the post. Thus
when someone makes an interesting post, it is possible to send e-
mail to the person and begin to correspond, or just encourage the
user to continue.

Also, there are political components being developed. For
example, there was an announcement that a vote was in progress to
determine whether or not there should be a classics newsgroup. If
one wrote voting "yes" or "no", the user would then be told to
verify that the vote was accurately recorded when the list was
posted announcing the final totals. Thus a procedure has been
worked out on Usenet acknowledging that votes can't be by
secret ballot, but must be open and posted, with the person
voting having the ability to verify the outcome.

Unfortunately, there are also frustrating aspects of Usenet.
The great variety and number of posts can take considerable
time to survey and it is often difficult to keep up with the
volume. A variety of software readers have been created,
to help deal with this problem.(10) Though these readers have
been copyrighted, many are freely available as long as they are
being used for personal use, not for profit. Despite the
difficulty keeping up with the volume of posts and other problems
that have developed in the course of building the Netnews
network(11), many of the users on Usenet are willing to be active
participants in the development and working out of the content
and form of the network. Many people send e-mail or post public
responses when they have something to say about a post. In this
way, communication is encouraged, as one person builds on
another's contribution, and all become more knowledgeable through
the process of democratic discussion and debate.

Usenet has thus evolved a functioning governing structure
that is democratic and open in ways that have only been dreamed
of in the past. Many of the details of the copying, distribution
and propagation of Usenet are done via automatic machinery
and programs which require that the system administrators who
make the system function work together to solve their common
problems. This same kind of cooperative relationship has been
encouraged by these system administrators among the users of
Usenet and this cooperative standard of activity is known as
Netiquette.

Many on Usenet call the structure which functions anarchy. But, Jean
Jacques Rousseau, in A Discourse on Political Economy, explains that the
best laws are those which the population implements voluntarily rather
than via force. "Netiquette" is a system of rules or standards that users
on the Net are encouraged to follow. Also, throughout the development of
Usenet, commercial traffic and commercial uses of Netnews have been
strictly limited and circumscribed for several reasons. Among these have
been the need since the early days of Usenet to keep commercial traffic
from both escalating the phone costs and the noise (i.e. proportion of
useless information to useful information) of Usenet. When the Internet
became one of the major transport mechanisms of Usenet traffic, the
prohibitions against commercial traffic arising from the public funding
of the NSF backbone became a factor.(12) This restriction of commercial
purposes has resulted in the open communication and cooperation which
commercial agendas make difficult. Thus the governing laws (Netiquette)
and structures (cooperative and helpful) are the demonstration that more
democratic government is now possible and can achieve significant social
advances. On the Net, participants gain from being active and from
helping each other. People who post or send e-mail are contributors to
the culture and all gain from each other's efforts. A vibrant and
informative bottom up, interactive grassroots culture has been created
and a broad, worldwide, informative and functioning telecommunications
network is the product of their labors.

Because those who are able to connect to Usenet are connected to
people all around the world, an exciting world of people and computers is
available to a user who has access to Usenet.(13) Also, the achievement
of Usenet demonstrates the importance of facilitating the development of
uncensored speech and communication -- there is debate and discussion -
one person influences another - people build on each other's strengths
and interests, differences, etc.

Traditionally, it would require the labor of many people, much
paper, ink, and other supplies to accomplish such a massive communication
network via traditional means of newspapers or magazines, etc. With
Usenet, however, this communication among people and computers is
accomplished via a high degree of automation. By participating in Usenet,
millions of people and their computers are connected into -- the global
telecommunications network. Also, Usenet makes it possible for people to
print up their own copies of what is available online, without using all
the paper or ink that has traditionally been required for a press. So
welcome to the World of Usenet - something very special is happening and
it is one of the important achievements of the 20th Century.

take note of the concern of some people at Bell Labs that AT&T's
rights in and to Unix source code and proprietary information be
protected. Greg however emphasizes that individual posters were
concerned with the ability to communicate, not with copyright
protection.

Geoff Collyer and Henry Spencer, USENIX Conference Proceedings,
Winter 1987.

6. Gregory Woodbury's article "Net Cultural Assumptions" describes how
the `public domain assumption' changed when the US government
revised its copyright law and became a Berne signatory in the
late 1980s. The implications of this change have been debated on
Usenet in the past year.

7. But whether the new newsgroup will be carried has
traditionally depended upon the system administrators of the
largest systems and the new group's inclusion in the list of
newsgroups.

the early days of the Net.

10. See Gene Spafford's "USENET Software: History and Sources"
for a history and description of many of the software readers now
available.

11. Various problems have developed that users need to deal with.
Some involve the efforts to impose copyright restrictions on
posts on Usenet which would make the copying and propagation
impossible; there are some users who try to intimidate people who
post by attacking them (called `flaming'), etc. But these
problems must be looked at in the context of the significant
advance that this Netnews network represents.

12. The National Science Foundation (NSF) had an Appropriate
Use Policy (AUP) governing what was allowed to be transported
across the nets that it funded with public moneys. It limited
usage basically to research and education activities. As Usenet
was transported across the NSFNet backbone, this policy of
the NSF helped Usenet to develop as an educational rather
than commercial network. (It is questionable whether a commercial
network could have been developed, given the secret and
proprietary activities of commercial enterprises.) However the
AUP restriction is being challenged now by the growing commercial use of
networks like ANS (Advanced Networks and Services) a company
founded by MCI and IBM that is now part of the MERIT, NSF, ANS
organizational chain, which is opening up access to commercial
traffic endangering the development and education and research
function that the net thus far has achieved. Also, many large
corporations, though seemingly restricted in their use of the net
to educational and research purposes, are also the backbone sites
along which Netnews is transferred. Some corporations use Usenet
for their research and educational functions, but run a separate
private net alongside of their Usenet operation for their
commercial purposes.

13. For a discussion of the value of Usenet, see for example,

in the Amateur Computerist, Vol 4 no 4, Summer, 1992, p. 22.
