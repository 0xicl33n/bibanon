# Netizens NetBook: On the History and Impact of the Net

This is a reformatted edition of Michael Hauben's and Ronda Hauben's on-line Netbook, [Netizens: On the History and Impact of Usenet and the Internet](http://www.columbia.edu/~hauben/netbook/index.html), hosted on the Columbia University website. This netbook presents the history and impact of various aspects of the Net: the Internet, ARPANET, Usenet, etc. We hope to provide information which will help readers to understand where the Net has come from so as to help preserve its value throughout future developments and changes.

Because the original text is only available in unformatted text files, post-production PDFs, and hard copies, the Bibliotheca Anonoma has taken up the task of restoring and converting this entire book into readable and parsable [[Markdown]] format, for better archival.
