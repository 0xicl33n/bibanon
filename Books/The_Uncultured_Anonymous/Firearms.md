Ah guns, they're a giant metal penis that shoots bullets into other men.
If you use them you are a fag for touching a metal penis. Most anonymous
are skinny little fags who have never seen or held a gun before.

But lets talk about them anyway.

## Choosing your Weapon

-   **Handguns** - Includes semi-autos and revolvers. These are are the
    only choice if you want to carry concealed. This is a small,
    versatile gun. There are also many calibers you can chose from for
    fucking someone up. Readily available in the U.S at your local pawn
    shop, or a bi outdoors store, such as Sportsman's Warehouse. Use
    most handguns at short to medium ranges. Some larger cartridges,
    such as a .44 Magnum, you could probably use to take somebody out at
    a 100 yards if you are a really good/lucky shot. It all depends on
    what you use and how familiar you are with your weapon.

**Common Handgun Calibers**

-   **9x19mm** - Very cheap and available round. Even the U.S. Military
    uses it. Good stopping power, good penetration, mild recoil. If you
    are getting your first handgun, get one in 9mm, even if its just for
    the inexpensiveness of the round.

-   **.45 ACP** - Also very common, but not nearly as cheap. Great
    stopping power, mild penetration. Great for self defense as it will
    usually drop people fast. Heavier recoil than the 9mm, but still not
    bad.

-   **.380 Auto** - Not as cheap as the 9mm, doesn't have the stopping
    power or the penetration either. But very mild recoil. Great for
    smaller/weaker people.

-   **.357 Magnum** - Made for revolvers, but there are some semi's out
    there that will take it. More expensive, about .70 cents or so a
    round, compared to the 10 cents per 9mm round. Great stopping power,
    great penetration. Recoil is a little heavy, but more of a push than
    a snap like the 9mm.

-   **.500 Smith and Wesson Magnum** - Completely, totally unnecessary.
    The goal is to shoot something not rip your hand off (some critics
    say it is comparable to the .357 mag; I have shot both guns, I think
    the critics are fucking retarded). This is currently the most
    powerful factory-made handgun in the world and you will have to pay
    out the ass for the cartridges ($3 per round). If you decide to
    purchase this firearm and use it, then please remove your asshat and
    try again.

Now, that list isn't even close to describing all the handgun rounds
available, or even the commonly found ones. If you really want to know
about a certain round, I hear that a place named Google is pretty good.

-   **Rifles** - These are big, unwieldy, larger caliber weapons. Mostly
    used for hunting(man and beast), you aren't going to be hiding this
    without a large flowing trench coat or something. Rifles aren't as
    expensive by the way, so anonymous might want to check these out.
    Always either in bolt action or semi automatic. Use these at long to
    medium range unless you've bought a military rifle that has a
    bayonet lug on it. Even then, unless you know how to handle it,
    don't try to close in and finish someone off with a bayonet.
    Terrifying as it may be, you fuck up your bayonet strike and you're
    up to your eyeballs in shit.

**Rifle Calibers** - Remember that rifle bullets are in a totally
different class than handgun rounds, so a medium power handgun bullet
does not have the same power as a medium power rifle bullet. Rifle
cartridges are generally much more fast moving and hard hitting that any
common handgun round.

-   **5.56 NATO** - In the medium power range as far as rifle cartridges
    go. Used by many rifles, such as the AR-15 and all its offshoots.
    Decent stopping power, great penetration, low recoil.

-   **7.62x39mm** - Very common round used by a wide variety of Eastern
    Block assault rifles, such as the infamous Ak-47. Despite its
    popularity, its not that great of a round for firing at anything
    under 300 yards, due to the heavy bullet and low powder charge. But
    it will go through just about anything, including steel plate body
    armor, due to its weight and design. Good stopping power, great
    penetration, mild recoil.

-   **30-06** One of the best rifle cartridges of our time, with great
    stopping power, great penetration, and great availability.

Recoil is moderate to heavy, depending on the rifle you use.

-   **.308 Winchester** - Flat trajectory, better than that of the 30-06
    similar penetrating power to the 30-06 but slightly more lacking in
    power due to a shorter cartridge. Both are fine for long-distance
    shots but past 500 yards the .308 is much more consistent and is
    more energy retentive.

-   **Shotguns** - These are essentially rifles, except instead of
    firing a single bullet, they fire a shot that spreads anywhere from
    a hundred BBs to one big bullet, called a slug. Slugs enable a
    shotgun to be used at a longer range that normal buckshot would. I'm
    not going to list the different shogun gauges there are, since the
    most common is the 12 gauge. Shotguns have heavy recoil, and should
    probably not be used by midgets, because it would roll them over. At
    close range some of them can blow a huge hole into your target.
    Shotguns (particularly pump-action models) are ideal as defensive
    weapons by virtue of their stopping power alone.

-   **Sub-Machine Guns** - A small rifle firing pistol bullets. Usually
    have a high capacity magazine. Some ones I can name of off the top
    of my head are the MP-5, P-90, MP-7, AK-74, Tec-9, IMI UZI, and the
    Mac-10. All vary heavily in what ammo they use, accuracy, and rate
    of fire. Pretty low recoil.

-   **Automatic Rifles** - A automatic rifle firing large caliber
    bullets. Usually have a large magazine, and high rate of fire.
    Common examples are the M4 and the Ak-47 and its variants. Accuracy
    also varies heavily here. Heavier recoil, but manageable. To quote
    Jackie Brown: "AK-47. The very best there is. When you absolutely,
    positively got to kill every motherfucker in the room, accept no
    substitutes."

Some of these are hard to come by, unless you know an arms dealer. This
isn't GTA, you can't just go down to Ammu-Nation and pick one up. Make
contacts, deals, shady friends in low, low places. If you need it,
you'll be persistent and you shall find a dealer.

## CHARGIN your LAZAH

Guns are very simple to use. Just follow these steps.

1.  Point at what you want to shoot, KEEP BOTH EYES OPEN IF YOU CAN.
    Look down the sights. Unless your target has a gun himself, hes
    going to be pissing his pants right about now.
2.  Hold your breath.
3.  Pull the trigger.
4.  Breath out as you release the trigger.
5.  Repeat step 3 until needed results are obtained.
6.  Say some witty line about your target dying.
7.  Clean up crime scene.
8.  ????
9.  Profit!

## FIRIN' your LAZAH

However, you can not just point and click anywhere. Aim for these spots.

-   **The head** - Hard to hit, but will kill him or put him down in a
    coma.
-   **The knees** - Best used if you catch your target off guard. Run up
    behind him and put your gun under his knee, in the fleshy bit. Fire
    away and his knee will be utterly destroyed. He will need a
    wheelchair for the rest of his life.
-   **The center of mass** - This is almost always the chest. Dead on
    the center of the chest. This is where all the organs are. It will
    rip through his heart and several arteries. Unless he gets to a
    hospital that instant, hes a goner.
-   **The calf** - One of the biggest arteries in the body is here, not
    only will he fall down, but he will likely bleed to death.

 (It is important to note that some people can withstand a single
gunshot to the chest and still come at you. It is important, when in a
firefight, to squeeze off two rounds into the chest within 1.5-2 seconds
of each other so as to maximize the trauma to the nervous system. The
more trauma to the nervous system, the more likely they are to fall on
the spot.)

## Ammo

If you're just going to kill one person, you don't need to look like
Rambo with tons of ammo hanging over you chest and everything. If you're
just going to kill the person and get the hell out, take one magazine,
put it in your gun, and maybe take another magazine just in case. You
don't need to shoot the person twenty times, and if you were paying
attention to the article and not drooling like a moron on the computer
desk, you should know where to shoot.

But, if there are a few guys, let's say three or four (and you think you
can take them - nobody need a dead anon) then you might need to take a
few magazines. Because if you run out of ammo in the middle of the
fight, you're done for buddy. But, if they don't have weapons, and they
don't suspect someone's after them, you have a much better chance.

## Proper use of your LAZAH in a gunfight.

If Anonymous ever finds himself in some grand gunfight against furfags,
Mudkipz, SPARTANS, or Slowpoke. Use these tips.

-   **Cover, cover, cover** - Find some cover Anonymous ! Anything that
    can stop the bullets that are coming towards you. Find something
    made of concrete or stone.

-   **Yes, do it like John Woo** - However unrealistic it sounds, try
    leaping through the air, doing back flips, cartwheels, all that
    shit. It will make you hard as hell to hit and you'll freak out the
    enemy when you fly around the place like Keanu Reeves.

-   **Like Legion, security in numbers** - If you've got a bunch of
    people with guns, trying to take down one person with one gun will
    be simpler and the success rate climbs. If you're alone, and get
    ambushed, you're fucked unless you're James Bond, Tony Montana or
    Chuck Norris.

-   **Above all, run** - Try to get out of the gunfight situation as
    soon as possible. Most likely you will die if you fight.
