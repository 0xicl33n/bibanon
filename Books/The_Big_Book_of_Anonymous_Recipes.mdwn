Here, Ladies & Gentlemen, is to be gathered the greatest, biggest, most honorable, tasty, and splendid, list of recipes to ever hit Anonymous's cooking skills. Based on the pitifully small subsection from [[The_Well_Cultured_Anonymous|The_Return_of_the_Well_Cultured_Anonymous]], 

## How to Add Recipes

[[!inline pages=!* rootpage=/book/The_Big_Book_of_Anonymous_Recipes/ rss=no atom=no postform=yes postformtext="Add a new recipe titled:"]]

Example: If you're making a recipe for Fried Chicken, you would type in: "Meat/Poultry/Fried_Chicken". See the  Use underscores rather than spaces.

If you set up a new recipe that belongs to a specific kind of dish (such as cookies or crepes), make a new folder for all such recipes under the right course and add a [[!ikiwiki directive/map]]. Leave here only a description, or the most basic recipe of all of them.

## Unit Conversions

For convenience it may be a good idea to include the units table in each sub-article and then stick with one unit system throughout - as you will likely write any recipe you try on a piece of paper you can convert to the measurements of your choice. Metric is advisable as it is simpler to scale recipes in a base-10 system if you wish to vary the number of cookies/whatever you produce.

## Salads

What, you don't know how to make salad? What the fuck, you chop the salad, put in croutons and some cheese. There, you have a basic salad.

### Basics

To keep it simple, the most basic rule of salads is that it isn't about what greens you put in; it can be cucumber, lettuce, tomato slices, whatever; all the subtlety lies with the dressing. I'm pretty heavy on sauce myself so I shouldn't really give you any advice on that, but it often goes:

* (olive) oil
* (balsamic) vinegar
* mustard
* pepper
* salt
* random stuff like chili, mint or whatever the fuck you want to put in it.

### All Salads

## Cheese

There's more to dining than pizza, and there's more to cheese than American Slices. If you've ever been unsure about anything except cheddar and mozzerella, this guide to cheese will help you out.

## Wine & Dine

Pairing food with wines or liquors is an art of itself, picking a good food and wine pair for a dinner party or dinner with your girlfriend will impress your guest(s) and make you appear moar sophisticated.
