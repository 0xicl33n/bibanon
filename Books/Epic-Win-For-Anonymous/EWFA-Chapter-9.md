## Chapter 9 - The Anti-Social Network

So declared WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in May 2011 during an
interview with Russian news site RT. A spokesman for Facebook responded
to CNET:

> We don’t respond to pressure, we respond to compulsory legal process .
> . . There has never been a time we have been pressured to turn over
> data [and] we fight every time we believe the legal process is
> insufficient. The legal standards for compelling a company to turn
> over data are determined by the laws of the country, and we respect
> that standard.

Facebook provides an increasingly invaluable service to its users,
allowing them to connect and self-actualize in exciting new ways. But
with convenience comes tension. Do we really want any single entity to
possess so much of our private information? Many net-savvy types who
don’t have turned to anonymous IRC channels, message boards, and
open-source alternative social networks like Diaspora to interact with
friends, especially when engaging in activities of questionable
legality.

Not surprisingly, 4chan is one of these places. The site’s radical
approach to online community (relative to other communities of its day)
has shaped the tenor of the discussion on the site. Some have called it
the Anti-Facebook, due to its refusal to track even bare-bones data on
its users. The two sites were launched within a few years of one
another. Both were built on shoestring budgets by young, hungry
introverts who ganked the basic idea from someone else and made it work.
Both are wildly successful, but in very different ways.

Facebook, with five hundred million users, dwarfs 4chan. Facebook
emphasizes the cultivation of a robust identity. It maintains a closed
system with a lot of rules. It made its founder billions of dollars,
brought generations of people online and furthermore made them active.
Facebook has redefined how humans communicate. Speaking purely in terms
of scale, 4chan is a tiny playground for bored geeks in comparison.

In David Kirkpatrick’s The Facebook Effect, Facebook founder Mark
Zuckerberg famously declared:

> The days of you having a different image for your work friends or
> co-workers and for the other people you know are probably coming to an
> end pretty quickly . . . Having two identities for yourself is an
> example of a lack of integrity.

Facebook has struggled over the last few years to define its stance on
privacy as it relates to the site’s sometimes shockingly targeted
advertising platform. And even the best privacy policy is rendered null
when a massive security breach occurs. Zuckerberg wants to encourage
what he calls radical transparency—which certainly sounds nice, but is
it really best for you?

Facebook was originally a niche community of like-minded college kids,
who turned to the site because they were unsatisfied with other services
that did not offer exclusivity. Now that Facebook is full of moms, where
do we turn to express ourselves the way we want?

In 2010, journalist Jeff Jarvis elucidated the public’s increasing
concern about Facebook’s privacy policy.

> They conflate the public sphere with the making of a public. That is,
> when I blog something, I am publishing it to the world for anyone and
> everyone to see: the more the better, is the assumption. But when I
> put something on Facebook my assumption had been that I was sharing it
> just with the public I created and control there. That public is
> private. Therein lies the confusion. Making that public public is what
> disturbs people. It robs them of their sense of control—and their
> actual control—of what they were sharing and with whom (no matter how
> many preferences we can set). On top of that, collecting our actions
> elsewhere on the net—our browsing and our likes—and making that
> public, too, through Facebook, disturbed people even more. Where does
> it end?

4chan offers a place where people are completely in control of their
identity, allowing for expressions of opinions without repercussions. In
a 2010 TED Talk, Christopher Poole explained his view on anonymity:

> The greater good is being served here by allowing people—there are
> very few places now where you can go and be completely anonymous and
> say whatever you like. Saying whatever you like is powerful. Doing
> whatever you like is now crossing the line, but I think it’s important
> to have a place [like 4chan].

Poole outlined 4chan’s core competencies and further explained his
devotion to privacy in a spring 2011 South by Southwest keynote speech.
He described a “loss of the innocence of youth,” using the example of a
child who moved to a new city and could reinvent himself in his new
town. Or even an adult who got a new job and wanted to change the way he
was perceived by coworkers. When you have a social network tracking your
identity wherever you go, online and off, that sticks with you. “You
can’t really make mistakes in the same way you used to be able to,” says
Poole. “The cost of failure is really high when you’re contributing as
yourself.”

> When you’re anonymous, it allows people to be more flexible and
> creative, and poke and prod and try a lot of things that they might
> not were they to have a little picture of their face next to all their
> contributions.

> I think anonymity is authenticity. It allows you to share in a
> completely unvarnished, unfiltered, raw way. I think that’s something
> that’s extremely valuable. In the case of content creation, it just
> allows you to play in ways that you may not have otherwise. We believe
> in content over creator.

So where’s the future? Will the Internet move inexorably toward
proprietary networks that require identification, or will the
open-source movement provide popular alternatives that cater to a public
that, given the rise of Anonymous, seems to be growing more averse to a
strong cross-platform identity? Some doomsayers have prophesied the end
of the Internet as we know it, with companies like Facebook becoming so
integral to the web experience that the open Internet will be seen as a
Wild West–like blip in Internet history. Others believe the future lies
with the freaks, the hackers, the Anons.

Hyperbole aside, it will probably be a mixture of both. Clay Shirky
draws a metaphor from an old 1986 computer game created by LucasFilm
called Habitat, considered to be the godfather of massively multiplayer
online games like World of Warcraft. In the infancy of multiplayer
gaming, software engineers’ programming knowledge outstripped their
understanding of social behavior, and their user experience decisions
were not based on previous knowledge. One contentious game play element
in Habitat was “Player vs. Player” or “PvP” killing. Experienced players
were able to handily murder noobs, which made the game less fun for
everyone but those who’d been there the longest. In addition, the very
concept of virtual murder was controversial. It didn’t take long for
trolls to start randomly killing other players as they wandered around
the virtual town. But if the engineers were to disallow PvP killing
entirely, they would rob players of the thrill of danger and the joys of
conquest. The moderators held a poll, asking if killing should be
allowed in Habitat. The results were split 50/50. So they compromised.
Killing would be disallowed inside the carefully manicured urban areas,
but the moment you left town and headed out into the frontier, you were
announcing to other players that you were down to scrap, if need be.
This clever solution pleased most players, and continues to be the
standard for many massively multiplayer games.

So will the Internet continue to look. Those who value safety over
freedom will hang out on Facebook and other proprietary communities and
mobile apps walled off with identity authentication. And those willing
to brave the jungles of the open Internet will continue to spend time in
anonymous IRC channels and message boards like 4chan.

Poole’s keynote speech also spoke to 4chan’s focus on meritocracy. Other
communities that focus on identity, and on rewarding people with points,
badges, and other accolades, develop strong hierarchies. Sometimes this
is good. You want the smart people who continue producing compelling
content to be rewarded.

But there are two ways this can go wrong. The first is encouraging
self-promotion at the expense of quality content. You don’t see social
media gurus trying to game 4chan in the same way that they do Twitter
and Facebook. The second is that it can put the focus on strong
personalities rather than on strong content. Longtime veterans of
communities are organically given more respect and their words sometimes
given more weight than they deserve. On 4chan, you’re only as respected
as your latest post. Its users are happy to let the hivemind take credit
for their creative work for nothing in return but the private
satisfaction of entertaining or informing one’s /b/rothers and the sense
of belonging that goes with it.

The success of 4chan as a meme generator has challenged everything we
thought we knew about the way people behave on the web. People are
willing to spend shocking amounts of time creating, collaborating,
documenting—and all with no recognition. The implications are
staggering. Give people a place that facilitates creation and sharing,
and they will conjure entire civilizations (witness the overwhelming
amount of lore preserved at Encyclopedia Dramatica).

While much of 4chan’s content is pure wankery, there’s something special
at work there. 4chan allows its users to be jerks, but more importantly
it provides a platform of social networking that focuses on what one is
saying rather than who is saying it. For all you know, the guy who
started a thread about particle physics on /b/ is Stephen Hawking. It’s
meritocracy in its purest form. The smartest, funniest, fastest,
strongest content wins, regardless of how popular, good-looking, or
renowned the post’s author is. Anonymous neither accepts nor grants
acclaim.

There are essentially twin themes that make 4chan what it is: the
participatory creative culture and the spontaneous social activism. They
can be seen as two manifestations of a process that social media
researcher danah boyd calls “hacking the attention economy.” Whether
through creativity or creative destruction, 4chan’s /b/tards (or
lowercase a anonymous) and the politically oriented trolls (or capital A
Anonymous) are exceptionally skilled at getting people to take notice,
without spending a single dollar to promote their work. Neither of these
capabilities could exist on Facebook at the same scale because they are
only made possible by 4chan’s emphasis on anonymity and ephemerality.

Many have speculated that if Christopher Poole had played his cards
right, he could have made bank with a community as big and as dynamic as
4chan. I’m skeptical. The moment one tries to monetize something like
4chan is the moment it stops being 4chan. Poole would have had to place
content restrictions in place in order to draw advertisers and sponsors.
And without restrictions, no company in its right mind (aside from the
lowest level of pornographers) would want to advertise on 4chan as is.
Furthermore, turning 4chan into a profitable business would likely
agitate the userbase to the point where it would revolt against 4chan.
4chan users have turned against the site in the past, and I’m sure that
any attempt to make much more revenue than what’s required to pay server
bills would result in not just a mass exodus, but raids and trolls of
epic proportions.

Poole recognized that. He rode the 4chan wave, gradually building a
personal brand in order to generate interest from investors so he could
finance Canvas. Many people in his place would have attempted to cash in
a lot earlier, only to be met with failure. moot played it cool,
managing the fringe elements of 4chan as best he could, learning through
trial and error how online community works. I believe he was only able
to pull it off because, like many start-uppers of his generation, he
doesn’t seem to be in it for the money. He wears the same plain hoodie
and t-shirt at parties that he wears when speaking in front of
thousands. He’s a true nerd who was able to feed his passions through
web community as a teen, and now he wants to give that experience to as
many others as possible.

In its infancy, 4chan acted like a swirling tornado, traversing the
geography of the Internet, picking up properties of the different web
communities that came before it: the collaborative creativity of the
Something Awful goons, the penchant for gross-out content from Rotten,
the anonymity of the Far East boards, the gleeful trolling of Usenet,
and so on. 4chan collected all those characteristics and mashed them up
into a unique slurry of content and community.

Throughout the past eight years, 4chan has grown large enough to get
attention, and other communities have formed in its wake. Know Your Meme
was created to analyze memes, Buzzfeed to report them, the Cheezburger
Network to monetize them. Reddit was born, which built small fences
around content creation and communication that corralled the creative
culture of 4chan, with fantastic results.

But as 4chan has scattered pieces of itself throughout the web, it
approaches mainstream. Does this mean the golden age of 4chan is over?
Will it cease to be what it once was, when millions of people buy this
book and learn all of its secrets?

“I’m not ready to say that 4chan’s over,” says Know Your Meme’s Kenyatta
Cheese. “If anything, 4chan will just go back to being the place it was
a few years ago.”

I’m with Cheese. As those twin themes of 4chan become increasingly
embedded in the mainstream, 4chan will go back to what it was before it
started getting write-ups in The New York Times: a place for bored teens
to shoot the breeze. When I asked danah boyd if she thought 4chan had
jumped the shark, she pointed out that a lot of 4chan users who were
there from the beginning have become literal oldfags. If you were 15
when 4chan started, you’re now 23, and most likely looking for something
very different in your browsing experience. When I first discovered
4chan, I was captivated, but it’s certainly not part of my daily
routine. I have to imagine that the turnover rate for /b/tards, at least
(the enthusiast boards probably hold onto people’s attention for much
longer) is very high, in the same way that hanging out down by the
railroad tracks is only interesting for a summer or two. But aren’t
those summers still supremely formative, even if it’s just killing time?
Even if 4chan has handed off its twin characteristics to the broader
web, it still contains something inimitable that is now a part of the
psyche of an entire generation, and, I predict, of generations to come.
Pretty epic.
