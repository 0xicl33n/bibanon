## Acknowledgments

MANY THANKS TO everyone, from entrepreneurs and university professors
all the way down to anonymous hackers, who took time away from more
gainful pursuits to contribute interviews. To my wonderful agent Chelsea
Lindman, for her faith in the project. To my editor Stephanie Gorton,
for her insight and discernment, and to everyone at Overlook. To the
team at Urlesque, for giving me a platform to expose the darker bits of
the web. To Kelly Noonan, for her constant encouragement, to Chris
Menning, for lending me his encyclopedic knowledge of memes, and to Nick
Douglas, who contributed not only a keen understanding of web culture,
but five years of unflagging enthusiasm for my creative work. Finally,
to my parents, Clay and Glenda, and Uncle Bob, who surrounded me with
love and books and a healthy appreciation for the peculiar.
