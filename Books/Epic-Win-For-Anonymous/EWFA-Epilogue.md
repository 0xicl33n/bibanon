## Epilogue

> “Keep your money we do it for the lulz.”

IN THE WEEKS since I finished writing this book, Anonymous has become a
household name. The media still doesn’t quite know what to make of it,
and straight society is trying to figure out what it’s all about. Are
these individuals really a bunch of leaderless teenage geniuses? A cabal
of trained anti-American terrorists? Do they represent the future of
civil disobedience, or are we experiencing a brief burst of web-based
pranksterism that will come to an end as soon as the rest of the
Internet is able to adapt to their methods?

On June 12, the group attacked the websites of the Spanish Police in
solidarity with three people who’d been arrested for their involvement
with Anonymous (authorities have also arrested Anons in Britain,
Australia, Spain and Turkey over the last few weeks). Three days later
Anonymous attacked ninety-one Malaysian government sites in retaliation
to their web censorship. The following week, Anon brought down several
local government websites in Florida in response to the arrests of
several members of a nonprofit who’d been feeding homeless people
against Orlando city ordinance. Meanwhile, Anonymous dug up contact info
for 2,500 employees of biotech giant Monsanto due to the company’s
business practices that, according to Anonymous, are marked by
environmental unfriendliness.

The latest attack was widely reported on July 11. Anonymous leaked
90,000 emails taken from the servers of military intelligence contractor
Booz Allen Hamilton. These sensitive documents contained correspondence
between the company and members of various military branches, the
Department of Homeland Security, the State Department, and others.
Anonymous laid out their charges against Booz Allen Hamilton in a press
release:

> Anonymous has been investigating them for some time, and has uncovered
> all sorts of other shady practices by the company, including
> potentially illegal surveillance systems, corruption between company
> and government officials, warrantless wiretapping, and several other
> questionable surveillance projects.

Furthermore, Anonymous has fractured into conflicting subgroups. The
most important splinter group claims no affiliation with Anonymous: Lulz
Security, or LulzSec, has snottily targeted several major corporations,
claiming ownership of attacks and pranks on Fox, PBS, Sony, the CIA, and
the FBI. Their motto: “The world’s leaders in high-quality entertainment
at your expense.”

Throughout May and June of 2011, LulzSec alerted the public to a new
high-profile hack every few days via the LulzSec Twitter account, which
has amassed over 283,000 followers as of this writing. Rather than
operating within the vast, anarchic Anonymous, LulzSec carved out a
niche—a small cadre of hilarious trolls who all clearly know their
stuff. They didn’t recruit, but their ideology was similarly populist in
nature. The group initially distanced themselves from the Anons, but
banded with them during Operation Anti-Security, or AntiSec, an ongoing
effort marked by vague anti-government sentiment. LulzSec released a
maritime-themed press release calling all “lulz lizards” to action:

> We encourage any vessel, large or small, to open fire on any
> government or agency that crosses their path. We fully endorse the
> flaunting of the word “AntiSec” on any government website defacement
> or physical graffiti art . . . To increase efforts, we are now teaming
> up with the Anonymous collective and all affiliated battleships . . .
> Top priority is to steal and leak any classified government
> information, including email spools and documentation . . . If they
> try to censor our progress, we will obliterate the censor with
> cannonfire anointed with lizard blood.

In early June, cybersecurity firm Black & Berg issued a challenge,
“Change this website’s homepage picture and win $10K and a position
working with Senior Cybersecurity Advisor, Joe Black.” LulzSec hacked
into the site, emblazoning the homepage image with their mascot, a
monocled, wine-swilling stick figure, and to add insult to injury wrote
“DONE, THAT WAS EASY. KEEP YOUR MONEY WE DO IT FOR THE LULZ” across the
page. It wasn’t even close to being LulzSec’s biggest attack, but it so
perfectly crystallized their mentality and exemplified their ethos of
trolling for trolling’s sake, with any political outcome perceived as a
pleasant side benefit.

Rival factions with names like Team Poison, The A-Team, Web Ninjas, and
a guy calling himself th3 j35t3r (leetspeak for “the jester”) leaked the
usernames of LulzSec’s core members. After fifty days of mayhem, LulzSec
abruptly called it quits, though it’s likely many of the group’s major
players will continue to act under the banner of Anonymous or rebrand
completely. Large organizations are likely scrambling to improve
security measures, but they can only do so much to out-think a sprawling
mass of devious computer geeks with anarchic inclinations. It’s likely
that Anonymous will exist for a long time, in one form or another, as
long as there are a few people ready to exploit the missteps of the
powerful, the corrupt, and the laughable.

Throughout my account of this curiously influential site, I traced the
motivations that drive Anonymous, from the freedom-fighting proclivities
of early hackers to the group’s paradoxical obsessions with the
revolting and the adorable. Closely linked with the rise of Anonymous is
the story of “little-A anonymous,” a phraseterm I’ve used to describe
the broader movement of anonymous social interaction and content
creation. There’s no question that Anonymous has outgrown 4chan. Few
pieces of media coverage even mention the site from which Anonymous
spawned anymore. But I’m confident that when their hacktivism ceases to
be a novelty, future historians will look back and recognize that the
story of little-A anonymous is just as meaningful.
