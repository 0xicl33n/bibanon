## Chapter 4 - Tracing 4chan Ancestry

LIKE EVERY OTHER web community, 4chan didn’t simply materialize fully
formed out of the ether. In order to understand the motivations and
interests of 4chan users, it’s helpful to know where 4chan came from.
The history of the web isn’t so much a story about technology as it is a
story about people, and how the ways they interact with one another
change when new technology allows them to try new things.

### Phone Phreaks: Pre-Internet Hackers

One might argue that the roots of 4chan go all the way back to the ’50s,
when a bunch of kids figured out how to get free long-distance phone
calls by whistling a specific pitch into the receiver. These kids called
themselves phone phreaks. Many of the phreaks were blind, with increased
sensitivity to sound that enabled them to quickly learn the right pitch
to mimic the phone companies’ control tones. Many were also social
misfits, drawn together from across the US by their shared interest in
technology, and more importantly, in breaking the technology.

In the late 1960s, one phreaker, John Draper—known by the nickname
“Captain Crunch” after he discovered that a plastic toy whistle
distributed in boxes of Captain Crunch cereal perfectly produced the
right tone to hack into the phone network—helped to spread the hobby,
which eventually permeated the MIT tech community, where the practice of
hacking into communication systems continued, along with the rise of . . .

### The Wild West: Usenet & BBSes

A lot of 4chan users laud their platform for hearkening back to the
early days of the Internet. “Back then it was like the Wild West. There
weren’t these structures in place to make sure that people stayed in
line,” one anon told me. Another said, “And forget about the thirty-page
terms of service documents.” If you stepped out of line, either you got
banned or your transgression became the new law of the land.

Dating the birth of the Internet depends on your criteria. It’s
difficult to pinpoint where a bunch of nerds playing around with modems
stopped and “the Internet” began. Bulletin Board Systems (BBSes) started
appearing in the late ’70s. These were mostly local communities, since
dialing into a BBS outside of your local calling area would have brought
hefty long distance charges. I’ve talked to a few dozen people about
those early days, from community managers to hackers to system
operators, and they all agree on two things: the Internet in that era
was expensive and slow.

BBSes were simple text-based precursors to message boards, where people
could post messages to everyone else who happened to dial in. The boards
often dealt with local interests and specific hobbies like fishing or
philosophy. There were also boards dedicated to computing and hacking.
It was in these that the first instances of what would come to be known
as leetspeak bubbled to the surface. This pidgin English was used by
hackers to get around wordfilters and, eventually, to avoid the prying
eyes of search engines. Hackers became h4x0rz, for example. This argot
is very common on 4chan, though it has been co-opted by people with no
hacking ability and is now either used ironically or by noobs attempting
to emulate the hackers of yore. Anyone who says things like, “ph34r my
1337 h4x0rz ski11z” isn’t going to bring down Bank of America any time
soon.

In 1979, three grad students developed Usenet, a file-transferring
network that ran on the Unix operating system. Users gathered in
“newsgroups” with threaded discussions much like the message boards of
today. Usenet differed from previous BBSes because it lacked a central
server and system administrator. Apart from leetspeak, Usenet is known
for being an early breeding ground for memes, though at the time they
were limited to in-jokes and slang such as sockpuppet, cleanfeed,
flaming, trolling, and sporgery. Despite the rise of more
technologically advanced forms of online community, Usenet has
experienced significant growth year to year.

Brad Templeton is a software architect and the creator of Usenet’s
“Emily Postnews” (Postnews is a double pun referring to etiquette expert
Emily Post and to postnews, a piece of Usenet software), a character he
created in order to establish basic Usenet etiquette, or netiquette.
Some of the principles he laid down came from as far back as the ’70s
and pre-Internet mailing lists. He explained to me that with so many
people struggling to figure out how to best use the Internet, it took
time to recognize how easy it was to offend with text.

Today, we take antisocial behavior on the Internet as a given. We
routinely read and say things that we’d never say in real life. When
someone lets loose with a string of expletives in a comments section I
roll my eyes and keep scrolling. But if someone said those things to me
on the street my heart would stop. During the early days on the
Internet, there were no agreed-upon standards of etiquette. Templeton
helped to define the way people would behave for decades to come.

### The Virtual Community: The Well

In 1985 Stewart Brand and Larry Brilliant founded the Whole Earth
‘Lectronic Link, or WELL. The WELL was made up of a new breed of
techno-utopian ex-hippies who’d been experimenting with communal living
and other alternative lifestyles. These baby boomers had grown up a bit,
and where their ’60s brethren had failed, they believed they’d succeed,
with the power of network technology. It was all very back-to-the-earth,
but with a focus on the power of computing. Words like cybernetic and
transhumanism were thrown around. Many of the community’s first users
were subscribers to Brand’s Whole Earth Catalog, a magazine devoted to
topics like alternative shelter, nomadics, and telecommunications. These
subscribers were already on the forefront of technology, and very smart.
This early user base would come to have a tremendous influence on the
quality of discourse.

In 1995, a decade into the WELL’s history, Wired magazine called the
WELL the world’s most influential online community. It was a
hyperintellectual environment that bore significant structural barriers
to entry. It was slow. It was complicated. And perhaps most importantly,
it was expensive. Between the monthly fee ($8), the hourly fee ($2), and
any additional fees exacted by telephone companies (to say nothing of
the cost of a computer and modem in those days), it wasn’t uncommon for
power users to burn through $300+ per month.

The WELL provided free access to reporters, which not only rewarded the
WELL with plenty of press, but also infused the community with a sense
of journalistic integrity.

I talked with former WELL Director Cliff Figallo, who can be considered
one of the first community managers. Today the field is one of the tech
industry’s hottest careers and a necessary component of nearly all
consumer-facing companies’ online strategies. Back then it wasn’t so
glamorous, and Cliff doesn’t have a whole lot of nostalgia for those
days. He’s quick to point out how much a pain in the neck running the
WELL could be. And he quickly dispels any image of the pre-AOL Internet
as an anarchic proto-4chan.

> I only had to ban one person in ten years at the Well. It was too
> expensive and difficult to dial in; the people who were there had a
> good reason to be there. We were very friendly, but very hands off.

I asked Stewart Brand, cofounder of the WELL and editor of the Whole
Earth Catalog, about the nature of anonymity in an effort to draw
parallels between 4chan and the infancy of the Internet. Unlike other
Internet communities of the day, the WELL forced identity on its users.
Stewart attributes the success of the community to “continuity of
community and absence of anonymity”—what he calls “the main
preventatives of destructive flaming.” The people on the WELL were
mostly friends who knew each other well. He says, “There was a fair
amount of raucous name-calling still, but there was also enough
community shaming of name-callers to keep it tolerable.”

> I made the no-anonymity rule specifically to avoid online vileness.
> After a while we did experiment with one anonymous conference, and it
> was so immediately destructive it was shut down within the week by
> popular demand.

Where Usenet had newsgroups, the WELL had “conferences,” subject areas
devoted to computing, religion, politics, whatever. The community was
like the Wild West in the sense that it was writing the rules as it went
along. This new territory didn’t have any mores. One defining maxim that
Stewart Brand coined for the WELL was, “You own your own words,” which
reinforced personal responsibility.

Cliff told me a story about cantaloupes and how this early community
dealt with unsubstantiated claims.

> Just after I was named Director of the WELL in August 1986, one of the
> WELL’s earliest members openly discussed her idea of starting an
> online news service using USENET (not the WELL) as her platform. This
> was more than five years before the Internet connected existing
> networks into a privately run commercial system. There had just been a

> journalist?” only gets hazier every day. Every day millions of false
> rumors are intentionally planted on the web. Tools are being invented
> to help support the social web’s ability to self-correct.

Given that the WELL was founded by optimistic hippies, I assumed these
geeks on the forefront of technology would have high hopes for their
hobby, but I was surprised to find the opposite.

“I had no idea the Internet would expand to the scale it is today.
Absolutely no idea,” says Figallo.

### The Eternal September

Throughout the late ’80s and early ’90s, universities granted their
students access to Usenet and other BBSes. Every September these online
communities would be flooded with new users who hadn’t learned the lingo
or the etiquette. The veterans would naturally look down on these noobs
with disdain, and dreaded the coming of September. In many cases,
trolling was an effective remedy.

In 1993, America Online began offering its customers Usenet access,
which brought the community thousands, and eventually millions, of new
users. These users were often the children of net-savvy parents who were
relatively less equipped than university students to provide value to
the Usenet communities. And the influx didn’t stop. The AOL users just
kept coming. Waves upon waves of noobs. Trolling isn’t as effective a
form of social engineering when the noobs outnumber the old war horses.

On January 26, 1994, Dave Fischer posted a message to the
alt.folklore.computers newsgroup: “September 1993 will go down in
net.history as the September that never ended.”

And thus the phrase eternal September was born. It’s something that
every successful Internet community experiences, but this represented a
massive shift in demographics for the web.

The Internet was no longer an exclusive haven for geeks; and a bit of
magic was lost forever along with the countercultural exclusivity of the
web. Rather than accept the mainstreamification, some geeks burrowed
deeper into weirder territory.

### Rotten, Stile Project and . . . Gaping Holes

Enter Rotten.com. I was first introduced to this portal to hell when my
meth head coworker at a fast food restaurant told me about this site
that “has, like, dead bodies and shit.” The site’s current header
includes a pretty clear disclaimer:

> The soft white underbelly of the net, eviscerated for all to see:
> Rotten dot com collects images and information from many sources to
> present the viewer with a truly unpleasant experience. Pure evil since
> 1996.

In 1999, the site added a regular column called “The Daily Rotten,” a
news feed dedicated to macabre stories of terrorism, abuse,
disfigurement, and perversion. A photo of a Chinese man supposedly
eating a fried human fetus was one particularly scandalous photo. An
image that still haunts my memory depicted a man who’d been nearly
consumed from the inside out by parasitic worms. The site is full of
tumors, birth defects, rashes, cysts, and other bodily terrors. Rotten
was disgusting, but the Internet was captivated. In the early ’00s, the
site received two hundred thousand rubbernecking visitors every day.

Tim Hwang, who went on to found the meme-centric ROFLCon convention,
admits Rotten’s peculiar appeal:

> In middle school, we were spending a lot of time online. And a big
> part of the attraction of the Internet is finding really nasty things
> to send to your friends. So, at the time we were passing around a lot
> of Rotten links.

For a wide swath of my generation, Rotten was a gateway drug that would
eventually introduce users to places like 4chan. More importantly,
Rotten served as an early whipping boy for censorship crusaders. In
1997, the Rotten staff unleashed a manifesto that would shape the way
people approached censorship on the web:

> The definition of obscenity, according to the Supreme Court and known
> informally as the Miller test, is:

-   must appeal to the prurient interest of the average person,
-   must describe sexual conduct in a way that is “patently offensive”
    to community standards, and
-   when taken as a whole, it “must lack serious literary, artistic,
    political, or scientific value.”

> Certain people (including parents and schoolteachers) have complained
> to us and stated that rotten.com should not be “allowed” on the net,
> since children can view images on our site.

> One US schoolteacher wrote us a very angry email that complained some
> of her students had bookmarked images on this site, that our site
> shouldn’t be on the net, and other claptrap.

> This is our response. The net is not a babysitter! Children should not
> be roaming the Internet unsupervised any more than they should be
> roaming the streets of New York City unsupervised.

> We cannot dumb the Internet down to the level of playground. Rotten
> dot com serves as a beacon to demonstrate that censorship of the
> Internet is impractical, unethical, and wrong. To censor this site, it
> is necessary to censor medical texts, history texts, evidence rooms,
> courtrooms, art museums, libraries, and other sources of information
> vital to functioning of free society.

> Nearly all of the images which we have online are not even prurient,
> and would thus not fall under any definition of obscenity. Any images
> which we have of a sexual nature are in a context which render them
> far from obscene, in any United States jurisdiction. Some of the
> images may be offensive, but that has never been a crime. Life is
> sometimes offensive. You have to expect that.

> The images we find most obscene are those of book burnings.

In 2001 the Rotten staff launched The Gaping Maw, which offered biting
cultural commentary and satire, like a bizarre, adults-only Mad
magazine. Because The Gaping Maw was hosted on Rotten, a site that was
routinely threatened with lawsuits, its writers could get away with just
about anything, providing some of the freshest commentary on the web.

A similarly rude site called Stile Project was founded in 1998 by a
teenager named Jonathan Biderman. In 2001, it gained notoriety for
hosting a video of a kitten being killed and prepared for a meal. PETA
naturally flipped out and attempted to shut down the site. Strangely
enough, Stile Project had been nominated for a Webby award the year
before. Stile warned, “This is quite possible [sic] the single most
offensive thing I have ever seen” in the video’s description; however,
he felt the video exposed people’s hypocrisy toward their food.

> To us it seems like the ultimate taboo. How could those Godless Asians
> do such a thing to such a beautiful creature? Well, I’m sure Indians
> wonder the same thing about us, but you don’t see North Americans
> shedding a tear every time a cow is slaughtered. . . . When’s the last
> time you cried over a Big Mac?

> I do not condone animal abuse, and I view the video more as an
> educational tool than one of shock value. For us to say it is wrong,
> it would just make us all hypocrites since most of us eat meat. I
> never get hate mail when posting images of dead people . . .

Rotten and Stile represent two sites that were built upon a larger web
trend of gross-out content. When I was a freshman in college, I remember
someone telling me to visit lemonparty.org (Don’t do it). The URL of
course leads to another shock site, this time a photo of three elderly
gentlemen tangled in bed. (And in the last US presidential election,
4chan trolls posted signs on telephone poles reading, “Politics left you
bitter? lemonparty.org.” Another sign read, “Sick of gas prices?
www.lemonparty.org.”)

For many, the experience of Internet shock sites began with goatse, a
notoriously repulsive image that is considered the king of shock sites.
It features a hirsute gentleman bending over and stretching his anus
wider than you’d think was humanly possible. The image was originally
hosted at goatse.cx (as in goat sex). The link to goatse.cx was passed
around by giggling teen boys, mostly, and used to troll unsuspecting
browsers.

In 2010, a group of trollish hackers associated with Encyclopedia
Dramatica, a wiki site focusing on 4chan culture, exposed a flaw in
AT&T’s security, revealing the email addresses of iPad users. They
called themselves Goatse Security (themselves an offshoot of the Gay
Nigger Association of America troll collective). Their logo was a
cartoonish parody of the goatse shock image, and their motto was “Gaping
Holes Exposed.”

### Nerd News: Slashdot & Metafilter

Slashdot founder Rob Malda, aka “Commander Taco,” says that he created
Slashdot because he missed the high-minded technical community he
enjoyed in the BBS era that discussed the sort of “news for nerds, stuff
that matters” that interested him.

In 1997, Slashdot offered something new: user-submitted stories. Each
story became its own discussion thread. The site became so popular that
when a story was linked by Slashdot, the site’s host would often buckle
under the weight of all the traffic. This phenomenon became known as the
Slashdot Effect. This phenomenon is not unique to Slashdot, but Slashdot
was one of the first to be routinely recognized as a server killer.
Other sites can be farked, for example, or undergo the Digg Effect,
demonstrating the power that content aggregators wield.

Malda says that Slashdot developed its own unique memetic culture almost
instantly. He remembers lots of gross-out memes popping up in addition
to stuff from the Star Wars prequels, which were hugely popular during
Slashdot’s early years. I asked him if there was a specific moment when
he realized that memes were a thing. He replied, “Long before I heard
the word, that’s for sure.” Many of Slashdot’s memes deal with ultra
geeky science and computing puns.

Malda claims that since he started Slashdot, the corporations have taken
over, our rights are on the decline, and our privacy is gone. Back in
the early days it was chaotic, but free. He recognizes the value in
anonymity, and feels that there’s something special about 4chan’s
community.

> I love that they interact anonymously. Slashdot was similarly
> completely anonymous for the first year of our existence, and still
> today we allow anyone to post without any identifying information
> whatsoever.

> I think a registered pseudonym is useful because it gives you
> continuity if not accountability. You might not know that “CmdrTaco”
> is actually a dude named Rob, but on Slashdot at least, you know that
> each time you see a post with that name attached, you know it’s the
> same guy. I felt for Slashdot that it was important to provide that
> for people that wanted it. I don’t think that creates a sense of
> “personal responsibility” in any sort of globalized sense, but it
> allows you to build a reputation and history which might be important
> if you want to be taken seriously.

Interestingly, anonymous posters on Slashdot are jokingly labeled
“Anonymous Coward.”

Matt Haughey was a big fan of Slashdot, but he wasn’t crazy about the
interface. Slashdot had editors that picked from submitted stories. Matt
was looking for something more democratic, so he created MetaFilter, a
community where anyone’s story could land on the front page.

The community blog became most notable for its Ask Metafilter section,
which was an early example of information crowd-sourcing. You could ask
an obscure question and, due to the size and quality of the community,
sometimes get surprisingly informed answers. This kind of querying would
influence sites like Yahoo Answers, Quora, Reddit, and, to an extent,
even 4chan.

According to Haughey, MetaFilter also developed its own memespeak pretty
early on.

> Probably in the first year, 2000 or so, I noticed people shouting
> “double post!” to something they’d seen before became a sort of game
> for people, where they wanted to be first to notice something was old
> and demonstrate their expertise at MetaFilter. There was also this
> early meme where a post that was really awful or boring would elicit a
> response of someone saying “I really like pancakes” and then everyone
> would talk about pancakes and we sort of had a pancakes-as-mascot
> thing for a while.

> My favorite meme is the current one where someone overanalyzes
> something at MetaFilter, people tell them they are “bean-plating”
> which started with one user poking fun at another by saying “HI I’M ON
> METAFILTER AND I COULD OVERTHINK A PLATE OF BEANS.”

MetaFilter users were known for being creative smarty-pantses, which was
reinforced by a simple decision by Haughey to charge users $5 to
participate for life. It’s a modest fee, but according to Haughey it
worked wonders in keeping out trolls and casual passersby who would
contribute nothing of value to the conversation.

Haughey is fascinated by 4chan, especially how it produces interesting
memes “from a place of total fuck-off anonymity.” Like most online
communities, MetaFilter asks its users to post under usernames, but Matt
recognizes the value in namelessness.

> I do appreciate moot’s point about how anonymity lets you be ok with
> failing, while a username feels more like “everything is on your
> permanent record” and people might be afraid to ever try something.
> I’m a big fan of failure and I think everyone should be terrible at
> everything they love for the first year or so they do it. I guess I’d
> rather see a world where everyone has a username and a permanent
> record and we all have these embarrassing beginnings where we openly
> failed again and again before we started to figure things out.

Slashdot and Metafilter were the first big content aggregators, and
their elegant feature sets have had a massive impact on the way all
media now behaves on the web. Long before Digg and Reddit came along,
Slashdot and MetaFilter provided users with a way to define what their
news would look like. This democratization of the media has influenced
not only the way news is consumed, but how it is formed, framed, and
distributed.

But what about all the news for nerds that doesn’t matter? What if it’s
not news, but . . . something else?

### “It’s Not News. It’s Fark”

In 1999, Drew Curtis unleashed Fark (a purposefully misspelled euphemism
for a word you can probably guess), an offbeat news aggregator that
would become a meme creation powerhouse. The formula was simple: Fark’s
community submitted articles to the site’s admins, who then
green-lighted the best ones for inclusion in the site’s news feed. Each
news story had an accompanying discussion thread that allowed the users
to engage in witty banter on very specific, immediate topics.

Before Fark, Curtis often read news stories on the web and emailed the
best ones to his friends, which he found to be a cumbersome way to share
and discuss information. So he created Fark, allowing millions to share
what essentially amounted to a giant global “News of the Weird” section.

Curtis was attending college in Iowa but living in Kentucky during the
early ’90s. A friend advised him to check out email, a cheap way to
circumvent expensive phone calls to campus. So he got an account and
started using email to correspond with his contacts in the Midwest. He
remembers a conversation with some friends:

> I asked, “What is the Internet good for other than chat and text
> games?” They couldn’t think of anything. Even porn wasn’t doing all
> that great. Conventional wisdom was free porn sites had no chance of
> working because the minute people found out about them they crashed
> under the traffic.

Because every news story provided a comment thread full of geeks trying
to outwit each other, Fark was an early breeding ground for Internet
memes. The comment fields allowed for images, so clever Photoshops and
wordplay abounded. One early meme was “Still no cure for cancer,” which
would append stories dealing with scientific advances in obscure,
seemingly useless fields of interest.

Curtis remembers when he first became acquainted with the term meme,
recalling the development of Memepool in 1999 and rattling off some
older memes that dried up long ago, such as Troops and I Kiss You. “It’s
how I know I’m old,” he says. One meme that sticks out most in Drew’s
mind is the legendary All Your Base Are Belong to Us, a garbled bit of
Engrish (i.e., badly translated Japanese often found in video games)
spoken by a villain from an old coin-operated arcade game called Zero
Wing. The phrase took off on Something Awful and was further popularized
by Fark. It eventually became a popular taunt in online gaming, a way to
tell your opponent that they’d just been pwned. (This was another goof
from video game land: in the frenetic pace of online play, people
wishing to taunt their opponents with “hahaha owned,” as in “You’ve been
owned,” easily made the mistake of typing pwned instead, as the p and o
keys are adjacent on most keyboards.) Today there are thousands of
photoshopped All Your Base images, and even T-shirts. It was one of the
first image memes to be endlessly remixed.

Curtis claims that this insular Internet culture went mainstream around
the advent of the big social networking sites MySpace and Facebook,
which brought so many people online and made it easy for average joes to
share content.

> One thing I find interesting is that there isn’t another Fark. There’s
> stuff that kind of looks like Fark but nothing really exactly like it
> . . . Right now I’m pushing the fact that the entire social Internet
> is set up to give you what it thinks you want—Fark gives you what you
> don’t know you want. It’s about the only place out there which
> intentionally isn’t putting you into an echo chamber of like-minded
> sheep.

Curtis says that the social aspect of the site wasn’t really his goal
from the beginning. He just wanted a place to share funny, interesting
links with friends, not much different than lots of link aggregation
sites of the day. He had a “Submit a Link” option on Fark from day one,
but after a year it became obvious that the site’s future was in user
submissions, so he made it a more prominent and integral feature.

> It became apparent that people were submitting material faster than I
> could find it manually. So I switched to selecting from the submission
> queue as opposed to searching the broader Internet. Wasn’t really a
> plan so much as I’m just lazy.

Curtis eventually discovered that the crowd’s ability to provide the
best bits of information vastly outpaced his own ability to curate
content. This rest of the media caught up to his discovery in the Web
2.0 revolution that occurred several years later.

It wasn’t just the unique features of his site that made it a success;
it was the changing infrastructure of the web as a whole. Blog software
was becoming popular and increasingly approachable, even for tech noobs.
It enabled unpaid, amateur writers and commentators to compete with
mainstream news sites, and aggregators like Fark, Slashdot, and
Metafilter gave them equal standing in terms of traffic. It wasn’t who
you were, it was what you were saying.

Curtis doesn’t have a lot of nostalgia for the good old days (“Things
were clunky and didn’t work all that great”). But things are always
changing:

> Another interesting thing I’ve noticed is that the VC [venture
> capital] dollars seem to scramble around based on the rules of web
> statistics. Look at all the money that poured into content farms
> [Demand Media, Associated Content], and now Google changed the rules
> and made them more or less moot (for now).

Curtis defines two major changes in the web since he started out: Tons
more people, and the presence of a generation of folks who grew up
online. Today, people are much more well-equipped to share the things
they like, and companies are being forced to come to terms with the
reality that their content has to be good, and that there is no secret
formula for creating a viral sensation.

Fark was the first of the big content aggregators with a focus on the
sort of offbeat stuff that people eventually recognized as being “from
the Internet”—in other words, Internet memes. One popular Fark meme was
a Photoshopped image of a kitten frolicking in a field, being chased by
two Domos (a creepy Japanese TV mascot that looks like a brown rectangle
with sharp teeth and beady eyes). The caption reads, “Every time you
masturbate, god kills a kitten. Please, think of the kittens.” Farkers
didn’t invent the phrase, which dates back to a 1996 student newspaper,
but the goofy image coupled with the amusingly sacrilegious phrase went
viral.

Another was the infamous UFIA, or Unsolicited Finger in Anus, which
derives from a news story posted to Fark about a high school football
player who poked a teammate’s butthole in a bit of jocular fun. The
other kid didn’t think it was so funny and pressed charges, prompting a
judge to eventually declare that an “unsolicited finger in anus is
crude, not criminal.”

Farkers gleefully beat this catchphrase to death, culminating in Drew
Curtis’s purchase of the naming rights to Boston’s Fleet Center for a
day, hoping to rename it the Fark.com UFIA Center. The Fleet Center
caught wind of the prank and opted to not use the name. However, a
Farker was able to convince the Tennessee Department of Transportation
to put up an “Adopt a Highway” sign that read “Drew Curtis TotalFark
UFIA,” which he explained stood for Uniting Friends in America. The sign
lasted a few days.

### “The Internet Makes You Stupid”: Something Awful

I discovered Something Awful, a wonderland of bizarre online culture,
almost immediately after getting online in the late ’90s. Its community
of “goons” thrived, providing perhaps the most direct Western antecedent
to 4chan, which was eventually spawned from its anime forum. Launched in
1999, the site charged a one-time $9.95 fee for forum access, which
thousands willingly paid to be a part of the strangest community on the
web.

Something Awful was a repository for lowbrow humor, with condescending
editorial commentary tacked on. Founded in 1999 by Richard “Lowtax”
Kyanka, the site featured daily essays about everything on the web
perceived as awful, with a focus on nerd stuff like video games, anime,
and script kiddie culture (script kiddies, or skriddies, are teenagers
who’ve learned a few basic hacking techniques and think they’re capable
of bringing down the Pentagon. Rather than hacking manually and writing
their own code, they use prefab scripts with little understanding of
what they’re doing). A trademark feature was the site’s “Awful Link of
the Day,” which shined a spotlight on some hilariously dumb corner of
the web. It might be a website fetishizing girls sucking on ice cubes or
some guy’s exhaustively researched argument about how the biblical hell
is geographically located within the earth’s molten core.

Other features on Something Awful include “Photoshop Phriday,” a weekly
image gallery that lampoons any old thing using image editing tools.
4chan users have turned this practice into something approaching an
Olympic sport. “Your Band Sucks,” a recurring column, offers hilariously
provocative essays taking down highly regarded bands. The “Weekend Web”
gathers quotes from weird message boards devoted to topics like urine
consumption as a spiritual exercise, white supremacy, or support groups
for those with self-diagnosed Asperger’s.

If there was something awful on the web, the guys at Something Awful
eventually found it and skewered it with unparalleled wit. But beyond
the collation and parody, Something Awful’s vibrant community eventually
began to form a unique creative culture of its own, which included a
collection of powerful memes. Perhaps more than any web community before
it, Something Awful harnessed the power of its community’s creative
abilities. With a bit of editorial direction, Something Awful managed to
skim the cream from the top of its goon community, creating grade-A
comedic content for web geeks.

Longtime contributor David Thorpe describes the site’s unique appeal.

> I think a fair number of people who wound up fascinated by weird
> Internet fringe stuff came from Stile Project. Something Awful was on
> the rise right around the time Stile Project was on the decline, and
> the two sites had a few crossovers once in a while. Something Awful
> was much more appealing because it was funnier and way less sleazy.
> Rich Kyanka, the guy who started it, was making fun of the Internet

> whereas Stile presented himself as the kind of C.H.U.D. [Cannibalistic
> Humanoid Underground Dweller, named after a cult classic b-horror
> flick] who was only one step above the people he was making fun of.

Thorpe joined the Something Awful forums in 2001 and hung around for a
while, simply because it was a community of fun people that he could
joke with. Zack Parsons, the closest thing Something Awful has to an
editor-in-chief, eventually offered him a gig writing for the site.

I asked Thorpe if he thought it was weird how mainstream meme culture
has gotten. When he started at Something Awful, a lot of the jokes and
slang that are now featured on MTV were solely the realm of these
hellaciously witty geeks on obscure Internet forums.

> I always sort of figured it would happen. The fact that people are

> because the stuff that’s making money is a lot of the dumbest stuff,
> the worst of “Internet humor,” like the lolcat shit. Another reason
> it’s depressing is because I’m not one of the people making money off
> it.

Thorpe points to the creation of image macros, which used to be popular
on Something Awful but have since died out due to their mainstream
popularity. These are basically images with text plastered on top;
lolcats are the most popular example. They were called macros because it
used to be possible to post popular ones by typing a code in the post
that would automatically generate the image. This is loosely based on
the computer science concept of macros by which input sequences are
linked to output sequences. In this case, code in, funny photo out.

How Do I Shot Web is a massively popular meme, with thousands of
iterations. It might be idiotic, but it’s a tangible part of web culture
that makes up the memescape. The non sequiturs and obsession with human
eccentricity were two powerful themes that defined Something Awful, and
later 4chan and Internet pop culture as a whole.

### The Birth of the Chans: Ayashii World, Amezou, and 2channel

Meanwhile, an enterprising Japanese slacker named Hiroyuki Nishimura
developed a message board in 1999 called 2channel, a text-only anonymous
forum that would eventually become a popular place for emotionally
repressed Japanese to vent. But what made 2channel special was its
almost complete lack of rules and anonymity.

2channel was based on a previous text board called Ayashii World, the
first big anonymous text board in Japan. It was an outgrowth of Japanese
Usenet culture, created by Shiba Masayuki in 1996. Because it was an
extension of Usenet, its subject matter was deeply nerdy, focusing on
hacking, pirating, porn, and other black market information. Ayashii
World, like 4chan, was unique for two reasons: anonymous posting and
meme creation. Ayashii World even had an equivalent to /b/, called the
“scum board,” which was used exclusively to plan raids (attacks on other
sites through hacking, spamming, or other destructive means).

The first image board meme, Giko-neko, was created here. It was
represented in ASCII art, a form of illustration using text characters,
as a cat, usually saying itte yoshi (Japanese for fuck off). Because the
cat could be easily copy-pasted elsewhere, with new captions, it was
easy for other users to make Giko-neko their own.

Ayashii World, like many anonymous chan boards, experienced so much
downtime that its owner began to receive death threats, prompting him to
shut down the board in 1998. When Ayashii World was shut down, many of
its users created their own textboards in an effort to create a new home
for nanashi, Japanese for anonymous.

The anonymous creator of one of the splinter boards, Amezou World, added
a new style of discussion threading called floating threads, which
displayed discussions in one chronological stream rather than in
branching conversations. Secondly, he integrated bumping.

As Amezou became more popular, it was increasingly targeted by trolls.
When violent threats eventually forced the creator of Amezou to shut
down his board, another round of splinter groups popped up to meet the
demand for anonymous community. Among these was 2channel, which brought
chan culture to the mainstream.

“I created a free space, and what people did with it was up to them,”
Nishimura told Wired in 2008, his laissez-faire approach mirroring that
of 4chan’s founder. In order to understand why 2channel was such a
raging success, it’s important to know a bit about Japanese culture.
We’re talking about a society wherein face-to-face confrontation and
emotional expression are actively discouraged. In the United States,
straight talk and audacity are prized as character traits. In Japan,
they are often interpreted as rudeness or disrespect.

It’s the culture of the salaryman, the lonely wage slave who lives to
work, with the few social pleasures he allows himself often related to
corporate team-building. The image of a salaryman is certainly a
stereotype (sleeping in a suit on a subway, late-night
corporate-sponsored karaoke), but there’s no question that this socially
repressed caricature represented a community that was waiting for a
platform like 2channel to come along. Today, the Japanese-only site
draws several million daily page views—more than four times the traffic
of 4chan, which is global. 2channel gives the people of Japan a place to
say what they’re really thinking, with no real-life consequences.

The 2channel welcome screen message reads, “Welcome to the large group
of bulletin boards that extensively covers topics from ‘hacking’ to
‘supper.’” More than six hundred individual boards are listed in a
scrolling column on the left, including “Large Special Vehicles,” “I
Love Dogs and Cats,” “Romantically Challenged,” and one of the most
popular, a board dedicated to the recent Japanese earthquakes.

One board, “Solitary Man,” seems to be a place for lonely males to
commiserate. I’ve found a thread in this board titled “What do you
prefer in the opposite sex?” The first post, penned by an alleged
16-year-old boy, details different characteristics, like height, age,
education, and attractiveness. The thread continues with people
contributing characteristics like “kind person,” “looks like Cameron
Diaz,” “likes housework,” “loves animals,” and “beautiful Japanese.”
Within ten replies, a troll offers his idea of an ideal woman, with
wings growing from her head, raptor claw hands and feet, and, of course,
beautiful breasts.

Because the site doesn’t allow images of any kind, the users have
developed a form of visual communication based on ASCII art.

These can be simple emoticons, like this angry fella, a 2channel
emoticon, or kaomoji:

[[images/00003.jpg]]

Some of them contain thousands of characters in order to create almost
photo-realistic visual representations.

Each discussion thread can potentially contain up to a thousand posts,
which either “age” or “sage.” Saged posts (from the Japanese sageru)
move down to the bottom of the thread, while aged, or bumped, posts
float to the top. This dynamic method of arranging content was
eventually borrowed by 4chan’s founder.

2channel is a place to argue, vent, cajole, insult, and goof around. The
users are sarcastic and sophomoric, and have developed a dense internal
lexicon. Those who aren’t in the know are said to be kuku yomenai, or
someone who “can’t read the air.” In other words, a noob or newfag.

2channel can get pretty dark. In 2000, a 17-year-old kid posted a
message claiming that he was about to hijack a bus, an act that he
carried out an hour later, stabbing one passenger to death. Racism,
especially toward Koreans, is rampant. Mass suicides have been organized
on the site, and criminals have boasted about their plans before
committing crimes hours later. Interestingly, many notable documented
events resulting from or announced on 2channel has a Western analogue on
4chan. The cultures are so different, but the technology influences
human behavior on a deeply similar level.

2channel also has a heartwarming side. Consider Trainman, an anonymous
2channel user who regaled the community with a story fit for a romance
novel. While sitting on a train he noticed an attractive woman. A drunk
man boarded the train and began to harass the other passengers, who
ignored him. Then he began to sexually harass the woman. Despite being
an introverted geek, Trainman took action, fighting off the man until
the other passengers were able to alert the conductor.

The woman thanked him profusely and asked for his address so she could
send him a token of appreciation. A few days later Trainman received a
beautiful French tea set. Overwhelmed by her thoughtfulness, he returned
to 2channel to update an expanding group of interested fans and ask for
advice. As a self-conscious nerd, he had no idea how to respond
appropriately. The folks on 2channel convinced him to contact the woman.
He eventually worked up the courage to ask her out on a date, his first.

Then, per 2channel’s advice, he got a new haircut, bought a snazzy
outfit, and picked up some contact lenses. His first date was a success,
and he continued to keep 2channel abreast of his progress. After a few
more dates he and the woman began texting regularly, and eventually
Trainman confessed his love, which she returned. Trainman triumphantly
announced their shared affection to 2channel, whose users banded
together for an ecstatic online celebration.

Trainman’s story is now folklore in Japan, having been adapted for
television, film, and manga. Though many are convinced of the story’s
authenticity, it’s never been proven, and neither Trainman nor his lover
have ever come forward in real life.

In a 2003 interview with Japan Media Review, Nishimura laid out the
site’s appeal.

> Q: Why did you decide to use perfect anonymity, not even requiring a

> A: Because delivering news without taking any risk is very important

2channel is now considered a media powerhouse on par with the country’s
biggest magazines and TV channels. And it’s completely open and free for
everyone, not just for viewing but for contributing and collaborating.
2channel behaves not only as an alternative media source, but as an
ombudsman that is continuously keeping the Japanese mainstream media in
check.

### 4chan Godfather: Futaba Channel

Futaba Channel, or 2ch, is an image board that was launched in 2001. The
community is more focused on otaku culture than 2channel is. Futaba
Channel contains around one hundred boards, some of which are devoted to
images, some of which are text only.

I wander onto Futaba Channel and sure enough, it looks almost exactly
like 4chan. I pick a board at random: “Two-dimensional Gro.” I’m met
with a warning page:

> You are about to enter the grotesque image board.

> Images on the grotesque image board may cause serious consequences.

I enter the board, consequences be damned. It’s full of images of anime
girls being suspended by hooks, or stretched out on examination tables
while being disemboweled, or smiling sweetly while bleeding, apparently
from having been recently quadruply amputated. Yuck.

I try the newest board, called “Nuclear.” It’s a forum for people to
discuss the potential for nuclear fallout, primarily related to the
Fukushima power plant. There seems to be a lot of anger being expressed
toward the Tokyo Electric Power Company, the fourth-largest in the
world, regarding its handling of the Fukushima nuclear accident in the
March 2011 earthquake and tsunami.

“No nuclear power plants should be up and running properly in a country
that cannot handle a nuclear accident,” writes one understandably
resentful poster. Everyone seems to be arguing about who is to blame for
the perceived lack of preparedness in the aftermath of the disaster.

This kind of venting is something that Japanese people probably wouldn’t
feel comfortable with in real life. Futaba Channel and 2channel, with
all their oddities, seem to offer a release valve for the Japanese.

The forums also provide an opportunity to achieve social good. In
October of 2004, thousands of 2channel users rallied to help in the
aftermath of the Niigata Prefecture Chuetsu earthquake. Right now, I’m
seeing hundreds of threads buzzing with people sharing information and
offering to help one another in the wake of the recent tsunami and
earthquakes.

### Collecting Bite-Sized Memes: You’re The Man Now Dog (YTMND)

In 2001, back in the United States, Max Goldberg launched the online
community You’re the Man Now Dog.

The site began as nothing but the words “You’re the man now dog” written
in ASCII text on a black background, at
http://www.yourethemannowdog.com. The line is prominently spoken by Sean
Connery in the trailer for the 2000 film Finding Forrester. By the end
of the year, Goldberg had changed the site to include a tiled image of
Connery, an audio clip of him saying the quote, and accompanying text
reading the same. It was absurd and useless, and people appreciated it
for exactly those reasons.

I remember someone sent me a link to it back in 2002. By the time the
audio clip had repeated a third time I’d thrown my head back in
laughter. Who made this? What does this mean? Why that specific line?
The ludicrousness of it all. YTMND is an early example of the
single-serving site, a URL reserved for an exceedingly singular, and
usually trivial, purpose.

Over the next few years, creative goofs would apply the YTMND model (a
pic, a sound clip, and text) to different weird pop-culture icons. So
many people created derivatives that Max eventually decided to set up a
site to host all of them, and //www.ytmnd.com was born.

The top-viewed YTMND is a clip of a prank call that was originally
recorded by comedian Tom Mabe. The second is a massive animated GIF
image created collectively by some clever Something Awful goons. The
YTMND wiki explains:

> The Blue Ball Machine is one of the most frequently-viewed pages on
> all of YTMND. The site is a patchwork of animated GIFs linked together
> accompanied by a looping hook of the song Breakfast Machine from the
> film Pee-wee’s Big Adventure. The concept was conceived by Andorion,
> who created a template and some sample tiles and a thread for others
> to contribute, and the individual images were created by hundreds of
> Something Awful forums goons. Each image has three balls enter and
> leave at particular spots at any frame which is a multiple of 30, but
> otherwise the content is up to the creator. It has earned this title
> by accruing a staggering four million pageviews since its inception in
> October of 2005.

The third is called “Breakup Letter: Dramatic Reading,” which features a
narrator reading an inarticulate breakup letter as though it were a
dramatic Shakespearean monologue, while trying not to giggle:

> Dear Loser,[Chris]~~~~!!!!!

> I thought you liked me you said it yourself I hate you. People only
> say you asked me out because you needed a date for the dance and that
> after the dance you would dump me well guess what bastert i dumped you
> cause you were thinking that i cheated on you i didnt so like idiots
> that you guys are and so smart that you are you called me a slut. I
> hung up on you cause you tol me it on the phone

That’s a small taste, but you get the idea. Moving down the list I see
an animated GIF of Paris Hilton that shows her using the same facial
expression in every photo. Another has the opening sequence of “Cowboy
Bebop,” only with audio of a Bill Cosby soundalike scatting over the
original music (Cosby Bebop).

The appeal of YTMND is that it allowed users to crystallize a single,
self-contained bit of absurdity into a unique URL that they could easily
share with their friends. There was also a feature that allowed people
to rate the clips, so the best ones rose to the top. For a time in the
mid-2000s, YTMND was one of the most powerful Internet meme aggregators.

### The Memesphere Expands

From the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s, the Internet birthed hundreds of
smaller sites that have come to be known as early Internet memes
themselves, or that hosted viral content before viral content was
recognized as something new. I’ve already told you about “Gonads and
Strife,” a cartoon from Threebrain, a flash animator who also released
such viral sensations as “Sorry Your Mom Died” and “Monkey Salad.”

realultimatepower.com is a good example, and it somehow remains intact
after all these years. The homepage begins:

> Hi, this site is all about ninjas, REAL NINJAS. This site is awesome.
> My name is Robert and I can’t stop thinking about ninjas. These guys
> are cool; and by cool, I mean totally sweet.

> Facts:

> 1. Ninjas are mammals.

> 2. Ninjas fight ALL the time.

> 3. The purpose of the ninja is to flip out and kill people.

It goes on like this. I distinctly remember the pure delight the
childlike wording of this home page brought to my college dorm. This
stuff was our generation’s Monty Python. It was fresh and funny and it
felt like nobody seemed to quite get it but us.

In 2004, Quiznos ran a campaign featuring the Spongmonkeys, who had
achieved viral fame with an animation called “We Like the Moon.” Joel
Vietch had originally created the video for his goofy animation site
http://www.rathergood.com in 2003. The ads featured the bizarre
creatures singing “We Love the Subs.” The monkeys were among the first,
if not the first, Internet memes to be used in advertising. The bizarre
nature of the Spongmonkeys ads confused many TV viewers, and the
requisite explanation was, “Oh, it’s just this weird thing from the
Internet.”

This phenomenon would reoccur a few years later, when one of the first
YouTube sensations capitalized on the strength of 4chan’s meme-spreading
capabilities. In the spring of 2007, a guy called Tay Zonday recorded
himself singing an original song called “Chocolate Rain.” The video
features an almost childlike Zonday crooning a surprising baritone into
a microphone over a cheesy drum loop. Zonday’s face contorts with effort
as he sings the utterly ungroovy tune. That November, Zonday licensed
the song to Comedy Central and released a spoof called “Cherry Chocolate
Rain” as part of an ad campaign for Cherry Chocolate Diet Dr. Pepper.

Newgrounds, eBaums World, and Albino Blacksheep, three successful web
communities, hosted videos, flash games, and animations from thousands
of independent content creators. Sites like these enabled people to
create one-off pieces of content that had the potential to go
superviral. At the time, there was a lot of arguing about content
attribution. eBaums World especially came under fire for hosting video
content it didn’t own. Today, these arguments seem almost quaint. There
are so many places to host content these days that it’s virtually
impossible to prevent people from sharing copyrighted content.

During this time the memesphere expanded rapidly throughout the web, and
people began to see pieces of entertaining content from the Internet as
a fresh new medium—but most people didn’t have a word for it yet. If
asked “What the hell is this?” we’d say, “Oh it’s just something I found
online.” Today we use the word meme.

Each of the communities I’ve just described is part of the gradual
progression in the evolution of the online community that created the
mother of all Internet in-groups, 4chan. Of course, online community
branched forward in different directions, mutating into mainstream
social networks like Facebook and Twitter too—but if you look closely,
you can spot the countercultural strains of the freaky, outsider’s web
community coming to a head when, in 2003, a 15-year-old kid decided he
was going to create the best site on the Internet.
