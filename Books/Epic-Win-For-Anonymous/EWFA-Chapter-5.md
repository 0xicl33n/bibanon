## Chapter 5 - The Rise of 4chan

BY 2003 THERE were plenty of English-speaking communities in place where
one could share cool stuff from the Internet, but for some they just
didn’t move fast enough.

Christopher Poole was a teenage anime geek who would frequent Something
Awful’s anime forum under the name “moot,” and occasionally lurk
Japanese forums like 2channel and Futaba. He appreciated the quick pace
of these sites. As soon as you get to the bottom of a page, you can hit
refresh and be hit with a page of completely new content. But because
Poole didn’t speak Japanese, he could only check out the images.

So he lifted Futaba Channel’s code wholesale and created 4chan.net, an
English-speaking forum that would bring the dynamic culture of 2channel
and Futaba Channel to the West. The site launched on October 1, 2003.

Poole posted a message to the Something Awful forums announcing the
creation of the image board. It was met with immediate positive
reception. No logins, no profiles, no hierarchy of users. Just a frenzy
of streamlined fun. With 4chan it wasn’t about who you were, it was
about what you knew, a pure meritocracy. People loved it. 4chan.org
received millions of hits in the first few weeks of its existence.
Eventually Futaba and 2channel users became aware of 4chan, which
brought in a flood of traffic, taking down the site’s servers.

I tracked down a guy who calls himself “Shii,” who is credited with
writing the software for 4chan’s text boards. On his personal site, he
claims, “I wrote the suck-ass anonymous message board software that they
still use today, despite never having taken a programming class ever.”
In 2003 Shii learned of the existence of the Japanese chan boards and
was excited to bring that style of forum to the West. That October, Shii
met moot online, who had announced the development of 4chan on the
Something Awful anime forum they both frequented called Anime Death
Tentacle Rape Whorehouse (ADTRW), a jokingly offensive name poking fun
at the medium’s extreme fringes.

Shii vividly remembers moot calling him up to deliver an hour-long
monologue about how 4chan was going to be the best site on the Internet.
moot made Shii a volunteer moderator, but according to Shii, they began
to butt heads when moot tried to turn the site into a business—though he
admits, “I’ve always had trouble consulting others before I do stuff and
I was not very professional, so he banned me from the site in 2005.”

Shii tells me 4chan was a very different place back in its infancy.

But it wasn’t always anonymous.

Shii claims he was enamored with 2chan’s culture of anonymity and
promoted it passionately on ADTRW and the Raspberry Heaven forums. ADTRW
contained a thread dedicated to Futaba Channel, where users posted the
weirdest stuff they could find, introducing thousands of Westerners to
the most bizarre stuff coming out of Japan. Shii says that most of
4chan’s earliest memes were mostly copied directly from Futaba Channel.

Raspberry Heaven was a DC++ file-sharing hub for ADTRW users that
eventually became a gathering place for those purged from ADTRW when
Something Awful attempted to clean up some of the nastier content from
its boards.

Anyway, Shii thought 4chan was the future.

Over the next few months moot would add and remove different boards
according to demand. He created a Guro board, catering to audiences who
were after animated depictions of sexualized violence and gore, and
Lolicon, for sexualized depictions of underage children. He would
eventually shut down both, possibly to appeal to advertisers and to
Paypal, who processed donations. The Lolicon board was also shut down
due to occasional floods of actual child pornography.

Shii admits that the availability of extreme pornography played a
massive role in 4chan’s growth.

> website, and which had previously only ever been pulled out by the
> worst kind of trolls to shock people.

After about a month moot began to ask for donations so that he could
maintain the onslaught of new traffic to the site. 4chan was plagued by
downtime throughout its early history, which would inspire others to set
up dozens of competing chan-style image boards like iChan, Infinitychan,
and Desuchan; these experienced temporary flares of traffic whenever
4chan was down, subsiding when 4chan went back online.

I got in touch with David Ashby, who runs an anime-centric chan site
called iiichan. Like Shii, he’s got a lot of nostalgia for 4chan’s early
days.

Before getting involved in the imageboard subculture, Ashby spent time
on Megatokyo, a massive otaku forum, but was frustrated with how
inefficient the average forum structure was, with the majority of space
on pages devoted to “extraneous nonsense” like gaudy signatures, user
profile images, and unnecessary bio information. He loved the community
found in message board culture, but not the bloat.

### Clash of the Chans

Ashby started iiichan along with several other 4chan refugees who were
tired of dealing with the site’s frequent downtime.

4chan was the first and most well-known, and no other English-speaking
chan-style image board would ever come close to usurping it in terms of
traffic or influence.

During this period there was antagonism between 4chan users and those of
other chan-style boards, wherein they would flood other boards with porn
and other spam. Ashby recounts conflicts that have been dubbed the Chan
Wars:

> Those sorts of floods were often the work of one or two individuals
> with either some imagined grudge or a hankering to troll the users of
> another site. It was never between the admins of the boards
> themselves. They could be triggered by any number of things: perceived
> mocking of another site, “theft” of memes or jokes, or simply a
> dislike of the content being posted.

According to Shii, the Chan Wars began as a result of a porn site called
HentaiKey whose owner was personally annoyed with moot for distributing
porn for free on 4chan. He sent complaints to PayPal and moot’s domain
registrar, which led to 4chan losing its hosting and original 4chan.net
domain—which gave rise to iichan as a replacement site for anime geeks.

According to one anon, some of the more overtly trollish /b/tards left
for 7chan en masse because this new site gave them more freedom to
engage in illegal activity. In other cases, 4chan users were drawn to
alternative chan boards because they had other boards discussing topics
like law, philosophy, politics, and history. Encyclopedia Dramatica
casts the birth of 7chan, one of the biggest alternatives to 4chan, in
biblical proportions:

> Anonymous toiled under Moot’s harsh rule for over 9000 years, building
> great pyramids unto him on many hectares of land. Anonymous cried out
> “When shall we be freed of this tyrant king, who so punishes us for
> our beliefs?”

> The Internet spoke unto Anonymous: “There shall be a baby born amongst
> you, a child prophet, and he shall be called Ian, and he shall lead
> you from this place. There will be some other guys too, but they will
> turn out to be faggots.”

> Upon his 17th year, the prophet Ian came before Moot and brought
> plagues of DDoSing and rebellion on his head. Ian parted the Internet,
> and led his people to freedom. Forty days and forty nights they
> traveled through the desert. Finally, on the last day, Ian dropped his
> GBC and proclaimed “This, my followers, is our new land. It shall be
> called 7chan.” And lol, the Internet saw that it was good.

This is just a snippet of the staggering amount of lore dedicated to the
different chan boards. Despite the tension between the different chans,
/b/ reached one hundred thousand posts in April 2004, one of the first
notable “gets.” Each post is given a number, and nice round ones are
often sought after in get threads (as in “I got it!”). The random anon
who posted the hundred-thousandth post wrote “lol Internet,” which
became an instant meme, as many get posts do. That summer 4chan had its
longest stretch of downtime, a full six weeks, which was triggered by a
complaint sent to PayPal, who had been processing 4chan’s donations.
moot was eventually able to get the site back online with some new
features and boards in August.

One Million Get!

In 2005, /b/ reached one million posts. moot experimented further with
the site’s principles of anonymity by removing the name fields entirely.
The site continued to suffer from hacks and downtime, but by spring of
2006 the site had reached ten million posts.

At this point 4chan’s tomfoolery began to extend outside of /b/.
/b/tards began to target Internet personalities, for varying reasons.
They attacked furries. (People who like to dress up in cartoonish animal
costumes called fursuits. Furries’ attraction to animals is often
sexual, but many furries insist otherwise. 4chan is especially
antagonistic to furries, though every Friday /b/tards post massive furry
porn threads, calling it Furry Friday.) They attacked pro-anorexia
message boards, washed-up celebrities, and the
MySpace-profile-turned-online-memorial of a seventh grader who took his
own life. Thrill-seeking /b/tards would find an easy target on the web,
post related info to 4chan, and mobilize dozens, sometimes even
hundreds, of anons in order to troll Internet users who’d caught their
attention.

In August 2006, moot posted a message to /b/, declaring that anyone who
posted illegal content (e.g., child pornography, personal information,
and raid-related calls to action) would be banned permanently from
4chan, and anyone who posted within illicit discussion threads would be
banned for two weeks. This led many users leave 4chan for other chan
boards. It has gone down in chan lore as /b/day.

### 4chan’s Eternal September Moment

If one had to pick an eternal September period for 4chan, it began in
2007. That was the year of lolcats and Tay “Chocolate Rain” Zonday. Most
importantly, it was the year of the Internet Hate Machine.

A Los Angeles Fox affiliate put together a breathless exposé on
Anonymous. It starts off like this:

> Anonymous. This is what “they” call themselves. They are hackers on
> steroids, treating the web like a real-life video game. Sacking
> websites, invading Myspace accounts, disrupting innocent people’s
> lives—and if you fight back, watch out.

At this point, the ominous music begins.

> “Destroy. Die. Attack.” Threats from a gang of computer hackers
> calling themselves Anonymous . . . They attack innocent people like an
> Internet hate machine.

“Hackers on Steroids” and “Internet Hate Machine” became instant memes.
I can imagine the howls of laughter that met this sensationalized news
report.

> Those who fight back face death threats. Anonymous has even threatened
> to bomb sports stadiums. Their name comes from their secret websites.
> It requires anyone posting on the site to remain anonymous.

> MySpace users are among their favorite targets. People like David.
> Anonymous hacked his site and plastered it with gay sex pictures. His
> girlfriend left him. They crashed his computer with a virus and used
> his own email to infect everyone on his friend list.

The report doesn’t mention 4chan by name, instead calling it “an
underground hacker site linked to Anonymous.”

> Anonymous gets big lulz from pulling random pranks. For example,
> messing with online children’s games like Habbo Hotel. The pranks are
> often anti-Semitic or racist, and always posted on the Internet. But
> truly epic lulz come from raids and invasion.

> Their most notorious stunt? A bomb threat against seven football
> stadiums, which drew national media attention.

Cut to a woman drawing her curtains, presumably to keep out lurking
members of Anonymous.

> This mother’s also fighting Anonymous. Her whole family’s been under
> attack.

> “They posted pictures of all of us.”

> Anonymous has posted their home address and phone number.

> “Pretty much said that ‘You’ve got all the information now. Do what
> you need to do. Go go go.’”

> Death threats started pouring in.

> “Your heart is breaking. You need to keep your family safe.”

> She installed electronic security, a phone tracing system, and bought
> a dog. Then she started tracking down Anonymous members and brought in
> the FBI.

“Buy a dog” has become another legendary meme. It’s used as a catchall
for mocking advice. If someone asks “What can I do to save money on my
tax return?” on Yahoo Answers, some /b/tard will inevitably reply,
“Maybe you should buy a dog.”

This news story set the tone for the media’s relationship with 4chan for
years to come. It’s marked by a weak grasp of Anonymous’s structure,
histrionic sound bites from supposed victims, and ham-fisted usage of
4chan lingo.

Slashdot founder Rob Malda posted the video, commenting, “Cringe as you
watch this video explain terms like ‘LULZ’ and show inspirational poster
parodies as evidence of the evils of this terrifying ‘Group’.” The
thread received over five hundred comments, nearly all making fun of the
report, which conflated comparatively harmless Anonymous trolling with
actual domestic terrorism.

One anonymous Slashdot commenter nailed the sea change:

> Seriously, /b/ is so mainstream now, it beggars belief. Here is a
> Slashdot article that mentions it in passing without so much as
> stopping to explain the term . . .

> It’s a shame really. For a short while, /b/ was a great little
> Internet phenomenon. Anonymity, with all its baggage, and somehow no
> lawsuits. Now, though, the old guard is quickly moving on. Anybody
> who’s frequented the site can attest to this . . .

> Despite my pessimistic tone, I predict that “Anonymous” will continue
> to grow. As more and more attention is given to these “secret
> websites,” more and more people are clamoring to become “hackers on
> steroids.” This new Anonymous will be larger, with more brute force at
> his call, but at the same time stupider, and less apt to create
> entertaining content. And paradoxically, he’ll be less anonymous than
> before. I see threads where a bunch of high-schoolers recognize each
> other based on posted photos and local memes.

A prescient analysis. Meanwhile, 4chan continued to grow as curious
onlookers who caught the news coverage wandered onto /b/ to see what all
the fuss was about. Wired ran a piece in January 2008 called “Mutilated
Furries, Flying Phalluses: Put the Blame on Griefers, the Sociopaths of
the Virtual World.” This article, written by Julian Dibbell, mentioned
4chan and finally provided noobs with a reasoned analysis of troll
culture.

Meanwhile at Gawker, my friend Nick Douglas (the college buddy who
turned me on to 4chan), wrote “What the Hell Are 4chan, ED, Something
Awful, and ‘b’?”—a report that remains the top source cited on 4chan’s
Wikipedia entry.

And so, shortly after its fourth birthday, and now with more than fifty
million posts, /b/ was flooded with new users like never before. Many
veteran users bemoaned that the newfags were only interested in
trolling, and cared not for meme creation and ultranerdy culture. This
constant grumbling about the “cancer of newfaggotry” became a recurring
theme on 4chan. You can barely scroll to the bottom of a page on /b/
without seeing someone complain about how newfags are ruining the board.

“Newfags can’t triforce” is a meme that began as a way for old users to
assert their authority over the noobs, and more importantly it showed
new users that they have a lot to learn before they can mess around on
4chan. The triforce is a bit of video game iconography, an ancient
source of power from the Legend of Zelda franchise that looks like three
triangles arranged in a triangular pattern. Oldfags will post the symbol
along with “Newfags can’t triforce.” New users who try to copy-paste the
symbol in their reply to prove their worth will learn that the pasted
symbol appears misaligned. The only way to properly display the triforce
is by using a complex set of Unicode characters.

From here, 4chan continued to garner news coverage for various trolls
and hacks, culminating in the anti-Scientology movement Project
Chanology, which made Anonymous, if not 4chan itself, a household name.
(See Chapter 8.)

### Meet Moot

On July 9, 2008, moot’s identity was revealed in a Wall Street Journal
article, “Modest Web Site Is Behind a Bevy of Memes.” The article
followed the template for 4chan exposés, starting off with a brief
introduction to memes (e.g., Have you seen these lolcats things the kids
are into?), easing into 4chan culture, highlighting Anonymous, and
dropping a few quotes from eggheads and anons that demonstrate the
surprising influence and size of the site. This was the first time moot,
now unmasked as a handsome young man named Christopher Poole, showed his
face in the media.

In the following three years, Project Chanology would peter out, with
Anonymous moving on to other targets (everything from Paypal and
Mastercard to Oprah and the Recording Industry Association of America).
4chan continued to churn out memes, and sites like Know Your Meme,
Buzzfeed, Urlesque, and the Cheezburger Network rose up to serve as
gateways between 4chan and the rest of the Internet. In 2010,
Christopher Poole announced a new project called Canvas.

Shii has mixed feelings about 4chan today, and he hasn’t followed the
site closely since 2005.

> Before 4chan, posting online meant developing an Internet reputation,
> no matter what you wanted to say. I only saw this as a negative thing,
> because I could only see the downside of traditional forums;
> self-aggrandizing egos became famous while interesting voices were
> drowned out, and pointless and exhausting Internet drama was constant.
> Anything that would shake up that banality was interesting to me. But
> I don’t think I could have foreseen the shape it would take beyond
> mere entertainment, which 4chan certainly invented and improved
> tremendously.

Shii explains that 4chan has created both good and bad: Anonymous as
social activist and Anonymous as stalker and harasser. Technology has
served the group well in both directions, with members becoming skilled
in initiating “life-ruining” attacks as well as impressive feats of
social good. He says that both types of activity are now coordinated
outside of 4chan in places like IRC and AnonOps. “4chan itself is not
really innovative anymore,” he says.

Today moot’s busy with Canvas, though he occasionally gives an interview
about the still-growing popularity of his first endeavor. In April 2011,
moot gave an AMA on Reddit, where he engaged with the community in a Q&A
session about Canvas and 4chan.

Someone asked him, “What do you think, ten years from now, the lasting
cultural legacy of 4chan will be?”

He replied, “That it shaped ‘net and IRL culture in a way that few other
communities/websites have.”

Quite an accomplishment for a 15-year-old kid.
