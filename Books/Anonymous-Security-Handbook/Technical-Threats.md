Basic Rule: Use as many security layers as possible. The question is not, whether you are paranoid, but whether you are paranoid enough.

A good beginning is to use a VPN and running Anonymous related Software from USB device or a Live CD. A proxy is ok, but is not as secure as a VPN.

Always use as much security layers as possible, but make sure to use them in the right way. If you don't know how to use them, you have to learn it first.

Most anons use VPN to hide their traces, they use SSL encrypted connections and they use #[[vhost]], when they are on IRC servers.

## VPN

When thinking of a VPN service, think first about the legislation of the country. A USA VPN might provide user data upon warrant issue. In other countries, such as Sweden and Iceland, this is unlikely to happen. They have a strong privacy policy, wich makes it harder for law enforcement agencies to get access. In adition, some servers do not keep logs of users. Also try to get VPN services that accept anonymous payments (For those that keep user billing information)

### Free VPN -- Not recommended. (see explanation)

If they aren't selling you a service. They are selling you. Additionally, many features are capped, and many free VPN providers will hand user data upon warrant. Also, many free VPNs work with ad companies. 

Don't put any sensitive material through it, and you might be fine. Might.

### VPN Tips

PROTIP: Don't use Commercial pptp on Windows.

It's been said, as telecomix pointed out, that some operating systems (Windows 7, Vista) might be vulnerable to an attack consisting in requesting p2p conns, wich could lead the malicious attacker to get the user real ip.

See https://www.ipredator.se/?lang=en For more information on this matter. Seems flaw has to do with ipv6 conns, so just ensure you use ipv4.

Anything that uses OpenVPN is good. And remember to factor in specific policies on user data storage and policies regarding that data. (Best option, no data loggin + no user billing loggin, + safe payment methods ie: Ukash and similar services).

## I2P - Anonymizing Network

More info: [[I2P]]

I2P is an anonymizing network, offering a simple layer that identity-sensitive applications can use to securely communicate. All data is wrapped with several layers of encryption, and the network is both distributed and dynamic, with no trusted parties.

Many applications are available that interface with I2P, including mail, p2p, IRC chat, instant messaging and others. All anonymous.

Make sure you start by launching I2P with the I2P Launcher button in the portable apps tray icon.

You can then use the integrated PChat client, it automaticaly connects to the I2P IRC server anonymously.

Join #anonops for to keep track of Anonymous activity. Many Operation channels are relayed between I2P and anonops.ru.

Enjoy your anonymity and privacy!

### IRC with I2P

* irc://127.0.0.1:6668
* Channels: #anonops , #opegypt , #opitaly, #opmesh
* Sites: (currently all down) anonops.i2p qr.i2p
* Telecomix IRC allows i2p tunnel

For more and active I2P sites visit

* http://inr.i2p

The ports I2P is using

* http://www.i2p2.de/faq#ports
  * See also your router's configuration.

### I2P installation and running on Linux

* Download and extract the installation files, no need for separate install (such as apt-get install).

* Run the router from /i2p folder with sudo sh i2prouter start. In seconds, I2P should open

a Konqueror-browser page of I2P-main console.

* Configure your bandwith settings. You might also consider opening some ports on your firewall for

optimising the use of your bandwith.

### Portable I2P (windows only)

contains I2P, several plugins (email, torrentclient), preconfigured browser, preconfigured IRC client and messenger.

* http://portable-i2p.blogspot.com

Before you can use anything on I2P, you have to start the I2P router from the portableapps tray icon-menu

with the button I2P Launcher.

### Anonymous surfing with I2P

* Go to your browser options/preferences (depending on your browser) -> network/connection settings

* Select manual proxy configuration

* In http insert 127.0.0.1 , for port insert 4444

* In https insert 127.0.0.1, for port insert 4445

Make sure that you have No proxy for as localhost, 127.0.0.1 so you'll be able to reach your I2P configuration page. To test your anonymity, go eg. to: cmyip.com.

## Tor Onion Router

Basic Rule: Tor does not encrypt the data you send. It just hides your IP by means of cascaded Proxies. Just installing Tor does not mean you're safe. For example, if you use Tor and log in to your real-life-email-account, you're doomed.

### Download Tor

* https://www.torproject.org

Download [Torbutton for Firefox](https://www.torproject.org/torbutton) (enable or disable the browser's use of Tor)

Anonymous provides so called [[Care Packages]]. It contains Tor as well as a bunch of other usefull things. If you cannot access the Torproject website, you may ask in the IRC channels for the Care Package.

## How to IRC

Basic Rule: Use SSL Port (in this case 6697). Always. Use #vhost. Always. IRC is public, if don't want an information to be spread in public, don't give this information in the first place. Ignore trolls. Always.

What is IRC? IRC is a free chat program that people around the world can use to communicate. It features multiple rooms for different chat topics, and private messaging between users.

When you join the Anonymous IRC network, do so only via SSL (point you IRC client to port 6697). Port 6697 is an unusual SSL port, just checking the Always use SSL box will not function. By connecting to SSL-Port 6697 your IRC-Client may give you a warning, because the SSL-Certificate is self-signed. That is OK, it simply means that it hadn't yet been registered to the VeriSign company.

After connection you register you nickname by using a fake email adress, then you /join #vhost and AFTER that procedure you join the channels.

### Basic list of IRC Commands

* /join #channelname

Joins #channel

* /part

Parts active #channel

* /query nick

Opens private conversation with nick

* /msg nick <message>

Sends <message> to nick

* /whois nick

Displays info on nick

* /msg nickserv identify <password>

Identifys your nick

* /ignore <nick>

to ignore a troll

* /topic

to see the topic of a channel

* /list

to see a listing of available channels

### Extended commands

* http://www.ircbeginner.com/ircinfo/m-commands.html

### Where to find current IRC information incase you can't connect

* http://www.anonnews.org
* http://www.anonops.ru/?id=servers
* Facebook (search Anonymous, Operation Tunisia) http://www.anonnews.org/chat (Loads web based IRC client with current server info)

### Security

* Use SSL to connect to the IRC. Server port is 6697.
* Use VPN software, or accounts to hide your IP. IRC servers are pretty secured, but not invulnerable.
  * Tor software is NOT an option (It's banned in the network due to malicious abuse).

Extra security consists in getting a vhost (Virtual Host)

* Register your nick:

    /msg nickserv register password fake@email.com

* /join #vhost

* when in #vhost type: !vhost any.fake.host

### How to Vhost

On the anon IRC servers you can ask for a Vhost. This will ensure that you are anonymous on the irc

network. By default you will have a host based from you ISP, something like this:

mynick@theservicefrom.125.comcast.suck.net or a hash if you've logged in by SSL:

mynick@6969E1A1T1COCK152.69.IP.

After setting a desired vhost you could be identified as: mynick@myvhostRocks.org.

1. You must own a registered nick to get a vhost.

    /msg nickserv register password fake@email.com

Explanation: This will tell the register service to reserve your nickname for later use

2. You must identify on that nickname to get it working.

    /msg nickserv identify password.

Explanation: Once you do this step you are ready to set up a vhost.

* Output: services.anonops.net sets mode +r Yournick

Explanation: The +r flag states a given nick is effectively registered and identified.

3. Join the #vhost channel in order to get the vhost working.

    !vhost fake.host.here

Explanation: After you apply for a vhost, the service will ban your nick from that channel for a

given ammount of time. Reasons are many. Lurkers can get real ip's from people. Switching vhosts

each 2 seconds might lag the server, and so on.

3. Eventually you can directly ask for the vhost via command without getting in the specific channel.

   /hs request vhost@hosthere

Explanation: this will avoid getting into the specific channel. But is not enough to get it working.

The vhost@ part is optional, the important part is the hosthere part.

Considering the previous explanation, use the following: /hs request hosthere

    /hs on

Explanation: This will effectively activate the vhost.

### Vhost Trouble Shooting

Q: I have registered my vhost, but once I log in it doesnt activate.

A: Have you identified with your nick? You will only get your regular vhost back once

your nick

is correctly identified, redo step 2.

Q: I just changed my vhost but it wont apply, why?

A: You need to update your status, in order to make it fully working. Use this:

    /msg nickserv update

* Output: HostServ- Your vhost of hosthere is now activated.

* Output: NickServ- Status updated (memos, vhost, chmodes, flags

Once you do that, you normally should have a fully functional vhost.

General Browsing Safety

Basic Rule: Always browse in "Private Mode" so that fewer traces of your web history remain on your HDD. Opera, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer all include a form of Private Browsing.

Using a free VPN will ensure your privacy in most situations online. If possible, use USB drives. You can nuke them if needed and if leaves no traces on your harddrive.

Use a different VPN for each of your online personas. When checking real email accounts, FaceBook, use a different VPN than from the one you use for Anonymous activities.

Recycle your online accounts as needed. A virtual name is just that, something people use to refer to you in given situations.

When creating accounts, use VPN or TOR bundle, that will give a bogus origin as well and make use of then Throw-away-emails.

### Useful (mandatory) plugins/extensions for Firefox

* BetterPrivacy (Removes persistent cookies from flash stuff >> *.sol)
* NoScript (blocks Javascript)
* AdBlock Plus (blocks Ads) (Subscribe to Easylist and Fanboy's List)
* Element Hider for Adblock Plus
* Ghostery (tracking pixels)
* TACO (More adblocking)
* Redirect Controller
* Refcontrol
* WorldIP (know your country, know your rights)
* Flagfox (tells you the country of the IP, don't use on Tor)
* GoogleSharing (GoogleProxy, i use it because Google is censored where i live, anonymizes the search) - Scroogle.org is also a very viable (and worthwhile) alternative
* User Agent Switcher: Sends bogus browser identity to servers.
* Optimize google: Allows to block loads of scum google uses to track searchs.
* Outernet explorer (MacOS) : Searches for a whole pile of shit on the net every 10 seconds or so, ensures anyone tapping packets will have a hell of a time.
* https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere: automatically loads https on a site if avaliable.
* Scroogle SSL search (Google anonymously): https://ssl.scroogle.org
