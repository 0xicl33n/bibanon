Basic rule: Security is a continuing process, not a state. Do audits on a regular and scheduled basis. And do encrypted backups. Backups are important, as there are two types of people, those who have backups and those who have lost their data.

## Protips

* use the operating system you are familiar with (Linux and Unix are better though, way easier to secure)
* uninstall everything you not need
* disable all remote tools
* shred or encrypt /temp, /var/temp and all world-readable files
* Encrypt your hard disk (Truecrypt : www.truecrypt.org)
* Debian and other linux distros offer to encrypt the harddrive during installation. Use it.
* Use a distro that boots from DVD/CD/USB
* Never ever keep logs
* Shutdown all unneeded services
* Use a firewall
* Use random password generators (KeePassX is a great tool for keeping such passwords somewhere safe)

* Public access points are perfect - just about. (correlating logins with CCTV could prove disastrous so security cameras should be avoided while using such 'free' services. Cyber caf√©s, Mc Donalds, and many companies offer Free internet access, remember though, not to surf those nets without a VPN and/or Tor.
* Keep private keys (pgp/gnupgp) in a removable device, and that removable device away from curious eyes. Encrypt the private key before doing this.
* Keep VPN certs away from curious eyes via removable device, or common hidden folders.
* Never use the same users/passwords on reinstall. Take the time to create a new one each time. Use password generators.
* BE paranoid. All rare activity in your computer must be checked and monitored. That will provide 2 things: knowledge once you identify it, and added safety. 

## Detecting potentially security flaws on Linux

But be careful, if you don't know how to read Lynis' output, you'll become paranoid deluxe.

Scanner for rootkits, backdoors and local exploits on *Nix

Again, if you don't know how to read Rootkit Hunters output, you'll get paranoid.

## Destroying data securely

### Unix/Linux

To securely destroy data under *Nix you have some possibillities. The command shred -u overwrites

singe files and deletes them finally, with wipe -rcf you overwrite and delete directories. Be carefull

because the shredded/wiped data cannot be recovered.

Open a Terminal and type

    shred -u <filename>
    wipe -rcf <directory>

If you feel the need to wipe the whole harddrive, the command is as follows for IDE-HDs (/dev/hda is the first HD)

    wipe -kq /dev/hda

For SATA and SCSI HDs you type (/dev/sda ist the first HD)

    wipe -kq /dev/sda

If wipe is not available to you, you can use dd. (again the first HD)

    dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda
    dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/hda

Use *both* commands, one after the other, if especially paranoid. Use them multiple times.
