**The Uncultured Anonymous** is another book similar to [[The Return of the Well Cultured Anonymous]]; it is still written by fellow [[Anonymous]], but deals in the ways that are considered "bad" or "undesired" within today's society. 

In other words, this is the complete opposite of the other book. This guide is set forth to teach you about all the things christfags get their panties into a twist about and to arm the next generation of anons with the cruel wisdom of their elders. 

Here, anons will help you on your way to becoming a legionaire while lying, cheating, stealing, smashing and laughing in the most evil and anonymous way conceivable.

There's plenty to edit and even more to add.
