The following is a list of authors, editors, and weeaboos who have done work on The Uncultured Anonymous. These are people who have contributed in some way to making this repertoire of evil a reality, and have done stuff on their lunch break to pull in information from websites like 4chan-420chan to ensure that you have a source of kickassery. Thank these people at your own risk, as they have their ways to make you an hero.

How do I added myself?

Just put your username.

Please do not add yourself unless you have given us useful shit. Changing a capital letter or fixing a spelling mistake is a weaboo move. Adding information (a shit ton), fixing a LOT of grammar/spelling/editing mistakes, or just helping out in any way possible IS being a contributor.

Also, DO NOT PUT YOUR IP AS YOUR REFERENCE. This is just because it's not really a way to recognize your work (and we don't want tripfags). Just register like an indecent person- I know it's against the Anon concept, but do it for the lulz. - Klg
