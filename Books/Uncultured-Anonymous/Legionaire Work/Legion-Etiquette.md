So, you want to be a true anon? This page should help you act like one.

## Legion Etiquette

The Legion is a destructive force of nameless, faceless assholes that
lashes out from its dark midst every now and again only to leave a trail
of downtime-related destruction and a flurry of quadruple digit
bandwidth bills where ever it touches down. This effect is achieved
because of two reasons:

1.  Anon is legion.
2.  Anon works almost as if it were a single body.

Although anon is to be feared and respected, he is weak without numbers
and powerless without discipline.

AnonÂ´s discipline is law. Those who break this law are disposed of,
either by other anon or by a third party.

## Legion Law

The legion does not follow the US Government's laws. Honestly, we don't
give a shit about those monkey niggers in Congress.

1.  DO NOT MENTION ANY SPECIFIC CHAN. If you're going to credit the
    chans, say it was the work of anon. Crediting a specific chan is an
    easy way to get the 4chan [[Partyvan]]
    on their ass, and anon will be fucking **pissed** at you.
2.  Bandwidth rape is only viable as a FINAL strike, not the first blow.
    The more bandwidth rapeage that goes on, the harder it is for anon
    to post [Lulz]y shit on the site. If posting horse porn is Iwo Jima, bandwidth raep is Hiroshima.
