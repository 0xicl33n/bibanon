Stalking is a fun way to get to know someone that you wouldn't be able
to get to know under normal circumstances. The main reasons for this is
either that they hate you, or that you're a coward. There are three
kinds of stalking. The most common kind is the stake out, which involves
looking through windows and the likes. The second most common is
tracking, which involves following the person to see what they get up to
out of the house. The third most common is media stalking, which
involves listening into their phone calls, bugging their house, and
hacking their computer.

## The Stakeout

The best time to stake someone out is when it is dark enough that the
person can't see you, but light enough that they haven't closed their
blinds yet. The stakeout is best done in a car or a van. Avoid FBI vans,
as you have already been in them enough. The best location is across the
street. Anything is possible, however, though sitting in the bushes for
hours may give you cramps, and get you soaked. The main things needed
are:

-   Food and drink, especially on long stakeouts. Donuts are the clich√©.
    Energy drinks are a good for, well, energy.
-   A bottle and a bag. Unluckily, you may have to piss and shit.
-   Binoculars, preferably with night vision attachments.
-   A laptop, because you are Anonymous, and this is required to live.

## Tracking

In a public place, tracking is a free for all. You don't have to worry
much, because there are too many people for her to notice you following
her. The main rule is, however, to dress like a normal person, so you
don't stand out in the crowd. Staying about 5feet behind is also
advisable. In less public places, you may have to choose hiding over
just walking behind her, as she will notice someone following her
instantly.

## Media Stalking

Media stalking will require either advanced hacking skills, or access to
the targets house. Since access is unlikely (as you have resorted to
stalking), you may have to break an entry. But that is advice for
another chapter. Spy cameras can be bought from most gadget stores.
