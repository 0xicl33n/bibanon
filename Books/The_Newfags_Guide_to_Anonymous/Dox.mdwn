Dox (and its phonetic counterparts like Docs) is the compilation of information of a particular target. Reports usually consist of two categories of information:

* Information in the Public Domain
* Information target intends to keep confidential (sekrit dox - this is usually where moar [lulz](/lulz) can be found) 

## Dox Content ##

Dox reports usually consist of the following:

* Name (Full)

  * Internet Usernames/Handles/Alias
* Address of Residence(s)
* Address of Workplace(s)
* Phone Number(s)
* E-mail Address(es)
* Criminal Record
* Info on Friends/Family

  * IP Address / ISP / Domain
  * Associated Parties (if applicable)
  * Financial History
  * Civic Notability
  * Misc. Info

  * (anything personal from Political Affiliation to sexual orientation to medical history)
<br>
Foreign addresses can be a bit hard to decipher. If you have something like a Danish address (Adress:Ekholmsnäsvägen 114 - 181 64 LIDINGÖ) put some kind of note into the bottom, or better yet, split it up int Zip code, street address, house number, etc. This is to be done for BOTH Americans and Europeans. (If you have some kind of qualm about the fattest country in the world, the one with the  most niggers, Jews, cats, etc. This is NOT the time for it, asshole)

* **[Google](http://www.Google.com)** - Google their name, email address. Use Google's cache to its full advantage - some forums require registration to view profiles / search often you can view them simply by clicking on the cached button on the search, do the same for sites that are down.

# Attack #


* **[Craigslist](http://www.craigslist.org/about/sites)** - Make a ad in the "free stuff" section, or in "erotic services" and "casual encounters" as is evident [here](http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/RFJason_Craigslist_Experiment) there are many horny men who will relentlessly pursue someone who they believe to be 19/f.
* **[STD Postcards](http://www.inspot.org)** - send one of these e-postcards notifying the target that one of their previous sexual partners has a STD. Makes for an uncomfortable wait for them. Alternatively call an AIDS hotline and ask them to anonymously tell the target they could have HIV, thats a 6 month wait until the test comes back.
* **[Free UPS Boxes](https://www.ups.com/labels?loc=en_US&WT.svl=SubNav)** create an account and order the target a couple of hundred boxes & labels, fedex also offer free boxes.
* **[Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/)** use Google maps to locate local businesses to mess with the target. Use searches such as:-
> > _"Pizza 78130"_
> > _"Locksmith London,UK"_
> > _"Emergency Plumber Toronto,Canada"_
> To locate businesses that will be able to visit the target at all hours. Be sure to have the targets dox to hand and to know nearby cross streets in order to give directions. When making an order, make it plausible e.g. 2 pizzas so that no suspicions are aroused. Occasionally businesses ask for a telephone number, unless you have a skype in number, it's best just to give the target's.

## Call them ##

When you first register a skype account you get one free call, however [call rates](http://www.skype.com/prices/callrates/) are fairly cheap and you can purchase skype credit in stores such as wallmart or purchase unlimited calls to numbers in N.America for just $3/month.

## EZ Dox ##

Heres an app I made that I think will find usefull. Just plug in the info and it will spit out a formatted txt document. Very simple. It's mainly for the newfags who have no fucking clue what they're doing or are too lazy to format their gathered dox into something readable by the average human. There are a few quirks to the program, so read the fucking readme. Also, filling in all fields is prefered because this is usually the minnimal ammount of info we need for a raid. <s>[EZ Dox jpegrar here.](http://freya.myvnc.com/dox/txt/pics/EZDox.jpg) (needs working link)
