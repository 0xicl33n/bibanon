"Pizza bombing" is term that encompasses techniques employed by insurgents to inundate marks with pizzas (or other delivered fast-food items) ordered from an online form.

## Execution Methods ##

### Telephone ###

For extensive tips, see [[Prank_calls]].
This is the obvious (and traditional) method.  Thusly, it is the most often AVOIDED method (see below).
TACTICAL PITFALLS:

* Most calling methods lack anonymity (read [[Prank_calls]]] to work around this).
* Calling is incompatible with macro software (It would be much too cumbersome to program a "pizza bomb via telephone" script).

### Online Forms ###

This technique employs the use of online order forms to place your order and special requests.
TACTICAL ADVANTAGES:

* Compatible with macros.
* Offers more anonymity than telephone method (Read PITFALLS for details).
* Ludicrous "special requests" can be added to most online order forms (read SUCCESS STORIES for examples).
TACTICAL PITFALLS:

* This method can reveal the IP address of the insurgent.

  * To avoid and work around this pitfall, use anonymity-preserving tactics (The use of proxies will typically suffice).
* This method may tempt an insurgent to abuse the form (by ordering enormous amounts of products from one service in a short amount of time), which may result in complete ignorance on behalf of the delivery service.

  * To avoid and work around this, simultaneously order typical portions from multiple forms (from SEPARATE delivery services).
* Dominos has been reported as employing Flash objects on their form's page to bypass a proxy.

  * To work around this pitfall, disable Flash while enabling JavaScript (via NoScript or a similar utility).
* Pizza Hut's order form has been reported to be enormous in size, rendering the utilization of a proxy quite hindering for an insurgent.

  * To work around this, you may want to use CURL to submit the forms.

## Examples of Success ##


* This technique was employed during the raid of [[WitnessX]].  Insurgents used the online order form to specify that they needed to write "/b/" with toppings on the pizza and exclaim, "Pool's closed!" when they opened the door.

  * This led the mark's mother to believe the pizza was poisoned.  She called the police in her panic, showing that minor steps can prove to be lucrative.
