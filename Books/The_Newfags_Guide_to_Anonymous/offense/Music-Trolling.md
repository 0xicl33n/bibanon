If you feel that you need to troll in a different way than the norm, here is how to troll with music.

## Steps ##

1. Find a band that is annoying, offensive, or both.
Most of the world's offensive music is considered either "Nazi Punk" or "Hatecore", so search using those terms. <br>
Examples include:

* Anything GG Allin
* Vaginal Jesus
* Anal Cunt
These bands tend to be the most effective in offending people. To find similar bands, use the label from one of them to search for more. <br>
Some annoying bands include  noisecore, grindcore, and noise rock. Basically, anything noisy will work; hell feedback and white noise are fine. <br>
Examples include:

* Anal Cunt (early)
* The grateful dead song "Feedback"
* Fuck... I'm Dead
* White Zombie (very early)
* Anything Shitcore
2. Download albums
3. Use on forums, IRC, IRL.
4. ?????
5. PROFIT

## What NOT to do ##

**DO NOT** use pop culture bands, as most people enjoy these, and that is clearly not the point.
**DO NOT** use the same song over and over again, since the lulz loses value over time.

## Wesley Willis lives in death ##

Wesley Willis, the musical genius of the 90s, set rap with highly original lyrics to the sound of a midi keyboard. The results are nothing less than fine art.
