### Last Measure  ###

DO NOT CLICK ON THESE SITES!
The most infamous of all shock sites, this complex page developed by Penisbird of the GNAA as a cheap substitute for crack opens mailto: and irc: links, a variety of pop ups, and a random shock image in the back, while the screen shrinks and hops around the page. The most well known aspect of this site is the wailing sirens and the screaming voices "HEY EVERYBODY, I'M LOOKING AT GAY PORNO!" Later versions of the site increases the lag and crash and added a chorus of voices of GNAA memebers. It usually ends in Internet Explorer or Firefox crashing, and on older computers a forced reboot.
The most often used Last Measure site is [<http://*.on.nimp.org>](http://anonym.to/http://*.on.nimp.org/), where * is any set of words you want. This supports fake links all throughout, so instead of a simple link, one can make deceptively complex ones, such as <http://youtube.on.nimp.org/watch?=4156742> (crafty, yes?).

## Shock Archives  ##

For raiding we want to have the best **shock pictars** and stuff, amirite? Well to do this we need to make sure we have collected enough of different types to use during different site raids.
Also these shock pictures and files need to be made sure that they're optimized, the more shock pics that load in the quicker on forums the better, especially for people still on 56k, also for hosting on our own sites so they take up less space and are easier to host using up less bandwidth.
Furthermore when put into the official pack they will be put into specific categories and named to better facilitate raep and corruption with them.

#### Proper Use  ####

The DO and DO NOT WANTs of your own shockpack:

* **DO** upload to photobuckets, imageshacks, and other free hosts
* **DO** upload to enemy sites if you can
* **DO** replace the images in a hacked Photobucket with these, keeping the filenames, so any images they linked to are now a shock image
* **DO** share a set of uploaded images with other /i/nsurgents

* **DO NOT** upload and link to from a *chan
* **DO NOT** place on a site that has links to this w/i/ki, a *chan, or anything that leads back to Anon
Keeping this in mind, you now have a perfect visual weapon against your foes.
