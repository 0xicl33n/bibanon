This one is pretty simple and even normal people do it to prank friends. Magazine subscriptions are easy to get, and paying for them requires no credit card - just the person's address. BE WARNED! You may have to step into the sunlight to get said magazine subscriptions. Wear sunscreen.

1. Go to a book store or any place that sells magazines. You may also have some magazines you've already purchased or have in your collection, you can use those too.
1. Rip out all the "Subscription" notecards. They're those flimsy little square pieces of paper that fall onto the floor when you are trying to read your magazine.
1. Fill out the "Subcription" notecards in ink with a different style of handwriting. Put your victim's address and name on them.
1. Put them in your local mail collector box. All of them should have "Paid Postage" - no stamps needed. 
TL;DR - Get subscription notecards, fill them out with victim's info, mail them to magazine company.
