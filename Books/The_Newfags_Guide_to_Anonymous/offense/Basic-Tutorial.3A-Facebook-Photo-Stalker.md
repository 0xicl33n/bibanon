Usually if someone is not your friend on facebook you cannot see his/her picture. Facebook allows you to see pictures in most cases.

## Method 1 ##


1. Login to facebook
1. Open this page <http://anonym.to/http://apps.facebook.com/josh_owns/?_fb_q=1&>
1. Copy-paste ID of a person or the URL to the page of person

  * (sometimes this gives you error, but keep trying with different URLs)
1. You can see albums and **descriptions** of pictures (potentially revealing useful information)

### Example ###


* You have a link <http://anonym.to/http://www.facebook.com/people/Harrison-Hoffman/10619489>
* Do you see the id????it is **10619489**
* PROFIT
