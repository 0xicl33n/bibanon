     **NOTE:** This shit hasn't been useful in decades
A slang term, phreaking is made up of two words; phone and freak. Phreaking generally entails learning about or exploiting systems which have to do with the phone system, but also encompasses voice-over-ip (VoIP). 

## History ##

Phreaking, in the sense of exploiting the phone system, started in the mid 50's, because of AT&T's recent addition of direct-dial long-distance ability. During this time, some people began experimenting with the phone system, in other words hacking the phone system. (p.s. someone add moar, I'm lazy)
Basically it's like this: everything in the old school landline phone system runs off of tones like the ones created by using the keypad. Some college students did a thesis paper on how it all worked, the specific Hz included, and some protohackers found it. An early Phreak, known as Captain Crunch discovered that a free whistle he got in his cereal (guess which one) would allow him to reset trunks. On an odd note, Joybubbles (mentioned below) learned how to do a bunch of this stuff, and passed it on to kids at his blind kids camp. So alot of the early phreaks that really got into this shit were blind, because what the fuck else are you gonna do, amirite? And here's the kicker: They can't stop this shit, ever. To change the tones, or what they do would entail replacing every phone in the entire world. Extremely detailed instructions, and stories about this cromagnon Anonymous can be found in the Jolly Roger Cookbook if anyone can dig it up (Cookbook get: <http://anonym.to/http://rapidshare.com/files/170998549/anarchistcookbook2000.pdf.html> ). The colored boxes give one an ungodly amount of power over the phone system when used correctly. (Note a lot of the boxes in the Jolly Roger are complete bullshit, out of the ones that actually worked very few still work today) Just don't do it from your fucking house, the shit is federal. One of the old phreaks ended up making a shitload of the blue boxes small enough to fit in a cig pack for the mob. Ma Bell was not amused.
Video that explains it quite nicely, it is quite lengthy, but nonetheless good: <http://anonym.to/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5464925144369700635>

### Joybubbles  ###

Josef Carl Engressia, aka Joybubbles, was a blind genius, who was sexually abused by a nun as a child. Being gifted with perfect pitch, he discovered that by whistling a tone of 2600 Hz, he could reset trunks, allowing him various possibilities to route phone calls through the system.

## Boxes  ##

Though many do not work now, because of changes to a digital system from analog, there are a few that do--these are mostly here for completion.

### Red Box  ###

Basically, in the early days (and some places today), the insertion of a coin would cause a specific tone to be output. People found that by recording these and playing them back, they could get free phone calls. The most popular version was created by replacing the crystal in a Radio Shack tone dialer which would cause it to generate the proper frequencies. Today it is easier to use an MP3 player or other digital audio device.
If you find a pay phone that is operated by the local telephone company there is a chance you may still be able to red box it. Ask the operator to dial a number for you, when they ask for your money play your red box tones and hope they accept it.

### Blue Box  ###

This was a box that gave the normal person the ability to act as an operator, again, because of certain tones. Hasn't worked in the US since the mid 80's.

### Beige Box  ###

This 'box' is built at least once by everyone and their grandmother. All it is, is two alligator clips spliced with the line from a phone cord. It is used to clip on to a phone line from the telephone network interface (the box with a phone logo on the side of the building) The red wire is clipped on to the right terminal and the green wire clips to the left. You can now place calls using that buildings phone line.

### DiTTo Box  ###

This is a phone with an added mic mute switch that can output audio to an external source such as a stereo or tape recorder, a sort of phreaker's wiretap. DoctoR DiTTo's original tutorial can be found [here](http://anonym.to/http://www.artofhacking.com/TUCOPS/PHREAK/BOXES/misc/DITTO.TXT).
