## Programming Languages ##

Here are some programming languages worthy of mention. 
> _Note: Scripting languages are not the same as programming or markup languages. Take your hypertext elsewhere faggots_

* [Assembly](/Assembly)
* [Bash](/Bash) - scripting language
* [Batch](/Batch) - scripting language
* [BBCODE](/BBCODE) **_EXPERT BBCODE PROGRAMMERS_**
* [C++](/C++)
* [C](/C)
* [C Sharp](/C_Sharp) - see: [Java](/Java)
* [Cobol](/Cobol) - nobody uses this (why is it here)
* [Java](/Java)
* [Haskell](/Haskell) - you have to have four PhD's to be good at haskell
* [Lisp](/Lisp)
* [LOLCODE](/LOLCODE)
* [mIRC Script](/mIRC_Script) (not a programming language)
* [Perl](/Perl)
* [Php](/Php) 
* [Python](/Python)
* [Qbasic](/Qbasic) (not a programming language)
* [Ruby](/Ruby) - In comparison with languages such as Python, Perl, and C, Ruby fucking sucks. (ruby can do what 100 lines of C can do in 3 with worthless built in functions though) [it will also take 4 hours longer]
* Visual Basic (real men do not program in this)

## So You Want To Learn To Program, eh? ##

Basically, before you start to learn anything, you're going to have to choose what you want to do with your 1337 skills, if you are interested in operating systems/hacking/cracking, then you should follow a path like this:

* [C](/C)
* [C++](/C++)
* [x86 Assembly](/x86_Assembly)
If you're more interested in web stuff/sploiting things, you should choose [Perl](/Perl) or [Python](/Python). If you want to make LOL GAEMS then you should just learn [C++](/C++), and if you're a comp sci nerd then [Haskell](/Haskell) or [Lisp](/Lisp) would be of interest to you.
_note:C#, Java, PHP, BASIC and Ruby are all [Shit](/Shit)_

## Tools ##

Pastebin's are a good way to share your code with other people so that they may give you advice / help debug your code if you are having problems.
