After a turbulent year of moralfaggotry, we feel that it is time to once again return to our roots.  As such, we here at the wiki are trying to re-organize things, add new tools, methods, raids, etc.  But we need your help.  This is a call to all skilled /i/nsurgents:  GIVE US YOUR AXE!  If you are good with scripting, doxing, raiding, etc, consider contributing a tutorial to the w/i/ki.  The w/i/ki staff will assist with formatting and making things pretty, so just worry about content.
Below is the format for contributing to the tutorial drive.  Go ahead and edit this page to contribute.

### QBASIC ###

<s>hey, Im gonna throw together a pretty good [Qbasic](/Qbasic) tutorial, mostly using stuff from petesQB tutorial (which is a classic tutorial on the language). The reason im letting you know this here is so that noone goes "LOLQBASIC IS USELESS" and deleted my tutorial
Qbasic is useful for people who are preparing to learn Visual Basic or something, or hackers (not script kiddies) who want to mess around with trying to remake, exploit, etc, old Qbasic programs. Enjoy.
done, here is link: [Qbasic](/Qbasic)
