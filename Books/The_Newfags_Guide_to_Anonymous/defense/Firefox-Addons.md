Cherimoya includes many useful Firefox addons and Greasemonkey scripts.

## Addons  ##


### Adblock Plus<https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/adblock-plus/>  ###

    Annoyed by adverts? Troubled by tracking? Bothered by banners? Install Adblock Plus now to 
    regain control of the internet and change the way that you view the web.
Most ads have two functions: To give you seizures and to place cookies on your browser for tracking. So we block them.

### NoScript<https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/noscript/>  ###

    The best security you can get in a web browser!
    Allow active content to run only from sites you trust, 
    and protect yourself against XSS and Clickjacking attacks.
This addon blocks all Javascript and plugins (flash, PDF readers, etc). Sometimes Javascript and Flash may be needed, so you can enable as nessacary.

### BetterPrivacy<https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/betterprivacy/>  ###

    Ever wondered why you are still tracked though you tried everything to prevent it?
    BetterPrivacy is a safeguard which protects from usually not deletable LSO's on Google, YouTube, Ebay...
Flash cookies (LSOs) are bigger than normal ones, much more dangerous to privacy, and even harder to destroy. Because you will sometimes need to use Flash, we've added BetterPrivacy to get rid of them if they exist.

### Ghostery<https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ghostery/>  ###

    Protect your privacy. See who's tracking your web browsing and block them with Ghostery.
This addon blocks known advertisers and their cookies (if enabled). It is made by Evidion (in the "self-regulatory program for online behavior advertising"), making it **extremely** questionable, especially if you enable Ghostrank. Sadly, there isn't really much of an alternative, so combine with Noscript and hope for the best.

### Beef Taco<https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/beef-taco-targeted-advertising/>  ###

    Sets permanent opt-out cookies to stop behavioral advertising for 100+ different advertising
    networks, including Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, all members of the Network Advertising Initiative, and many other companies.
Beef Taco is a modification of the original TACO, which became a bloated corporate sucker not long ago. It simply sets opt-out cookies for advertisers, although it's only useful if they follow through.

### HTTPS Everywhere<https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere>  ###

    HTTPS Everywhere is a Firefox extension that encrypts your communications with a number of major websites. 
    Many sites on the web offer some limited support for encryption over HTTPS, but make it difficult to use. 
    For instance, they may default to unencrypted HTTP, or fill encrypted pages with links that go back to the unencrypted site.
If a site has a SSL/TLS encrypted version, this addon forces Firefox to use it. It works on Google, Facebook, Twitter, Wikipedia, etc. Important for Tor, especially due to the threat of malicious exit nodes. 

### Torbutton (Alpha for Firefox 4.0)<https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/>  ###

    Torbutton provides a button to securely and easily enable or disable the browser's use of Tor. 
    It is currently the only addon that will safely manage your Tor browsing to prevent IP address leakage,
    cookie leakage, and general privacy attacks.
By messing with Privoxy, we might even be able to make it use the I2P when .i2p or .b32 domains are detected.

### MafiaaFire Redirector<https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mafiaafire-redirector/>  ###

    It can be a pain to remember alternative domains when the main domain is moved or illegally seized.
    Rather than mess around in your hosts file or keep a list of alternative domains and copy/paste this 
    add-on automatically redirects you to the correct alternate site.
It's the addon "they" don't want you to install. This takes you directly to the IP address of a site whose domain was taken down in the interests of "national security", so there isn't a need to screw around with your hosts file or anything.

### User Agent Switcher<https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/user-agent-switcher/>  ###

    The User Agent Switcher extension adds a menu and a toolbar button to switch the user agent of a browser.
If you set it to Googlebot, sites may be less likely to advertise or give cookies to you. Installing new Firefox addons will be a bit clunky, though.

### Chatzilla<https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chatzilla/>  ###

    A clean, easy to use and highly extensible Internet Relay Chat (IRC) client.
This addon gives you an AJAX IRC client that runs within Firefox. However, it is strongly recommended that you use the Cherimoya's built in IRC client, [Konversation](/Konversation), instead.

### Greasemonkey<https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/>  ###

    Customize the way a web page displays or behaves, by using small bits of JavaScript.
This addon allows userscripts to be injected into a site for more functions. Go to the [Firefox Addons#Userscripts](/Firefox_Addons#Userscripts) section to see what we've added.

### Stylish<https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/> ###

    Restyle the web with Stylish, a user styles manager. Stylish lets you easily install themes
    and skins for Google, Facebook, YouTube, Orkut, and many, many other sites. You can even 
    customize Firefox and other programs themselves.
This is like Greasemonkey, but for CSS. Make your favorite websites look way better. Check out what we've added in [Firefox Addons#Stylish Scripts|this section.]

### KDE Wallet Password Integration<https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/kde-wallet-password-integratio/>  ###

    This is an extension that allows firefox use kde's kwallet password manager to store passwords.
Sadly, Firefox is not native to KDE and handles user passwords by itself. To keep things more secure and portable under your KWallet, this addon is used.

### Banned Addons  ###

Not all addons are good. The below are wolves in sheep's clothing.

* Web of Trust<https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wot-safe-browsing-tool/>

  * This addon actually tries to track you with Google Analytics and Feacebook cookies. Yeah, it's important for their database, but this means they are watching your every move. Stick to manually checking their website (with NoScript, of course).

## Userscripts  ##

These are Javascript files that make websites function more efficiently on the user's side. Greasemonkey is required for the use of userscripts.

### Reddit Enhancement Suite<http://reddit.honestbleeps.com/>  ###

    RES provides several addons to enhance your Reddit browsing experience - each of which is configurable. 
    You can enable/disable any of the modules, and most of them have their own options that can also be personalized.
Reddit's design sucks compared to others, but it's is home to the most important, thriving internet communities around. This userscript makes the design easier to swallow using a bunch of modules, and increases efficiency.

### 4chan X<http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/51412>  ###

This userscript gives 4chan some much needed functionality, including thread hiding, automatic report button, and others.

## Stylish scripts  ##

These are CSS files that give a website a whole new, beautiful design. Useful for giving good ol' sites an efficient, Web 2.0 look.

### Appchan<http://userstyles.org/styles/46162/appchan>  ###

4chan's design is really old and clunky for such an important site. This script gives it a whole new look and function, with a floating postbox and a black background. Did we mention the silouhette of Horo?
