{{Policy|w/i/ki:CYCLE}}
![](File:RaidChart.gif)
The Raid Cycle is a theoretical model of how /i/nvasions are conducted.
A good /i/ raid should last as short as possible from planning to execution - no more than 48 hours - to prevent spais and whiteknighting from alerting the target and ruining the raid.

## Raid Proposal ##


1. Raid is proposed in [Le_/i/nsurgency](/Le_/i/nsurgency).
1. If proposal is good, make wiki article based on [Site Raid Template](/Site_Raid_Template) or [Personal Raid Template](/Personal_Raid_Template), using the <Template:Raid_Infobox>, following the format "Operation: Something".
1. Make a 209 x 195 pixel raid icon to go at the top left of the page.

## In Development ##


### Raids that Need Your Help ###


1. A sysop will add the raid to the [Raids](/Raids) page under the [Raids#Raids that Need Your Help](/Raids#Raids_that_Need_Your_Help) heading.
1. Begin the planning to include the method, target, site or personal information, and IRC channel. Discuss this in [Le_/i/nsurgency](/Le_/i/nsurgency).
1. Arrange for recon of the target and add information to wiki.

### Good New Raids ###


1. When {{Tname|Raid Infobox}} is completed, a sysop will move the raid to [Raids#Good_New_Raids](/Raids#Good_New_Raids) on the Raids page.
1. Complete the planning to include the the raid time and date, and add the raid to the [Events Calendar](Special:Events) by adding [[Category:Events]] and [[Category:dd/mm/yyyy]] to the bottom of the page.
1. Issue the orders by making promotional material, YouTube videos, etc., to be publicized on the [Le_/i/nsurgency](/Le_/i/nsurgency)
1. Supervise on /i/ and in IRC to ensure everyone knows and follows the raid plan.
