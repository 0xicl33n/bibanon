Yes, you. Stop asking us how to hack, how to take down
a web site, how to get revenge on someone you know online, 
this is _NOT_ what we are about. Don't ask us, just don't.

You have a talented group of people sitting around, waiting
to help you with staying Anonymous online, using IRC and a 
plethora of other things that don't involve breaking the law.

Knowledge is power, none of us "got to where we are" over night.
We don't need any more point-and-click revolutionaries, so
if you're serious about learning more about the digital world 
you find yourself in, we will point in the right direction. 

Here are some resources for the Anon minded netizen.

If you don't understand a concept or how to use a program, you can
ALWAYS look it up, give a man a fish, feed him for a day, teach
a man to fish, feed him for a life time. We would like you to
learn how to fish, without being handed the answers.
