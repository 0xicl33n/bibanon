GOOG411 is a free service that connects your call to any listed business in America.  Can't make landline calls from Skype, but want to pull some pranks? 
Call **1-800-GOOG-411** (1-800-4664-411) for free. When the machine picks up, a robotic man with a sexy voice will ask you what city,state and business you're looking for and then give you a list of matched businesses & services.
No worries about calling every 10 minutes for 8 hours straight - he's a robot.  
This process also puts you behind 2 companies (skype and then google), making it harder for authorities to trace you
