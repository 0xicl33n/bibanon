FAQ (in no particular order)

Q: Can you help us?

A: See http://www.anonops.ru/?id=contact or join irc.anonops.ru, join a channel and contact an operator. Or contact Anonymous on Twitter, Facebook.

Q: Do you guys have a website?

A: Nothing that's official. But most people end up on http://anonnews.org , or the IRC chat at http://www.anonops.ru

Q: How do I know what's hot?

A: Lurk in the IRC channels or go to http://www.anonnews.org

Q: Is the news on Anonnews official?

A: Well, in some way, it is official, on the other hand, it is „official“ and on the third hand the more people support an operation, the more official it becomes.

Q: Why not attack that newspaper/TV/Radiostation?

A: Anonymous does not attack media. Neither should you.

A: Freedom of speech counts for assholes too.

Q: But, but. .

A: As Evelyn Beatrice Hall said, „I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.“

In the words of Noam Chomsky: „Either you believe in freedom of speech precisely for views you do not agree with, or you do not believe in freedom of speech at all.“

Freedom of speech. Got it?

Q: So, there are rules? WTF?!

A: Yes, do not attack media and do not promote violence. Easy, eh?

Q: What are DDoS and defacements good for anyway? It doesn't help the people.

A: DDoS is all about steering media's attention towards the problems of the people. If media takes notice and spread the news, this will help the people. The fine art of defacing a website is about sending a message to the people and the owner of that website. Besides that Anonymous provides the people with information and guides and software to circumvent censorship, also know as „The Care Package“

A: Software like Tor Onion Router, a Circumventing Censorship Manual, more software, other guides and usefull stuff.

Q: I have seen this downloadlink in the channel, can I trust it?

A: Only you can tell yourself who or what to trust. Generally, the download links in the topic are most trustworthy, the ones spread by operators second, and ones from random anons the least. Make sure to test any link or download you are going to use.

Q: Some guy asked me in the IRC where I live and what my name is.

A: Do NOT provide personal information in IRC. Instead contact an operator and tell him what happened. Same goes for other suspicious behaviour.

A: Anonymous is not a club.

Q: But how does that Anonymousthingy function anyways?
