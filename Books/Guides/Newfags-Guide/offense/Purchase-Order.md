How to raep someone IRL using purchase orders (POs): 
Corporations don't buy things by actually paying for them, they send out a PO, which is just a promise to pay later after the goods or services have been rendered. This is standard business practice. 

* Take an anonymous prepaid credit card
* Buy an anonymous VoIP fax service 
* Obtain a professional looking form from a print shop 
* Fax POs through tor 
* Most companies will ship no questions asked after receiving a PO. Said companies will come after your target and sue them and ruin their credit, and they'll have fucking tons of shit that they don't know what to do with. 
An anon has reported ruining huge using this tactic. He's had steel beams and giant drums of chemicals dumped on people's lawns. He's also just given "PO numbers" over the phone, but if its more than 10k of shit at once they'll definitely want a PO faxed. If its a big shop that has their shit down like IBM or Adobe, no matter how much you order from them, even if its $5 they'll want a signed faxed PO. 
tl;dr faek sum POs and corps will just do shit for you. Imagine steel <s>niggersgirders on someone's fucking lawn?
