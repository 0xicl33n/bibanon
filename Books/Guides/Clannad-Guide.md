CLANNAD 300 Hour (Spoiler-free!) Guide

Pulled from Lyxie's [blog](http://soukyuu.emevas.net/CLANNAD_guide.html)

1 Recommended Play Order:
=========================

Minase --\> Tomoyo --\> Yukine --\> Ryou --\> Kyou --\> Kappei --\>
Sunohara --\> Kotomi --\> Fuko --\> Toshio --\> Nagisa --\> After Story

\

The last three (Fuko -\> Toshio -\> Nagisa) is very important, if you
don't follow this order you will miss a few scenes in both the main
story and the after story.\
Misae and Tomoyo are very close friends, and it'll be better understood
if you play Misae's route before Tomoyo's route.\
Ryou's route should be played before Kyou's route, as Kyou's route is
just the continuaton of Ryou's route.\
Kotomi's route is actually very independent of other everyone else's
route, but it is better if you play it before Nagisa's route.

2 Notes:
========

The '\*' marked choice are the essential ones. For any other choice you
can choose what you want for different dialogues.

The “[N]” where N is a number tells you the number of the choice.

3 School Life's:
================

**Attention:**\
Enter Sakagami Tomoyo's route after Sagare Misae 's

\

**Tips:**\
Ichinose Kotomi's route is completely independent from other routes, and
can be done any time you like.\
Ibuki Fuko's route is independent from other routes as well, but should
be completed earlier.\
Miyazawa Yukine's and Mei Sunohara's routes can be played parallel. On
the 20th of April, save on the first choice.\
If you choose to “help”, then enter Mei Sunohara route\
If not enter Miyazawa Yukine route.\
\
Fujibayashi Ryou/Fujibayashi Kyou route and Kiiragi Kappei route can be
played parallel. On the 20th of April, save. On the 28th of April of the
twin's route, save also.\
April 20\
> Choose “help” to enter Kiiragi Kappei route\
> Otherwise enter Fujibayashi Ryou/Fujibayashi Kyou route\
April 28\
> Choose 'I like short hair' to enter Fujibayashi Ryou route\
> Choose 'I like long hair ' to enter Fujibayashi Kyou route\
\
Koumura Toshio and Furukawa Nagisa's routes can be played in parallel.
On the 4th of April, save.\
> Choose 'pass the ball to me' to enter Furukawa Nagisa route\
> Otherwise enter Koumura Toshio route\
\
Sagare Misae and Sakagami Tomoyo's routes can be played in parallel. On
the 21st of April, save.\
> Choose 'enter Misae's room' to enter her route.\
> Otherwise enter Sakagami Tomoyo's route\
\
A total of 8 lights can be collected in the school life section. But one
might disappear from making a wish for Fuko\
CG/Music Mode will be unlocked after you complete one route for the
first time\
After Story will be unlocked after getting 8 lights and finishing Nagisa
+ Fuko's route. If you made a wish for Fuko then it will be unlocked
with 7 lights\
You only loose lights for once. Repeating the same event will not deduct
any more lights.

tape in the beginning of the story! Can you get it all?\
\
There are two versions of songs Sunohara will sing on the 15th. That

Complete After Story once and return to Tomoyo route. Sunohara's face
will deform at some point when beaten!\

In Fuko's route, do various pranks to get the title Fuko Master and
eventually Fuko Ninja and you'll have Fuko appearing like a ninja when
you reply Tomoyo route.
