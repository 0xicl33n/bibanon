The Anarchist's Cookbook is a set of instructions of how to do some, well, morally unacceptable things, to put it in the best way. Basically, it's similar to [[The Uncultured Anonymous]].

The first edition was written in 1970 by a disgruntled Vietnam War protestor. He became a Christian moralfag and has attempted to stop it's publication. Thankfully for us, his publisher prevented him from doing so, and now we have sites running to update, add to, and fix the Anarchist's Cookbook. It has changed a lot since then.

We got the 2004 edition as txt files from [[1000 Tutorials]], so if you have anything to add or stuff to update, check [these forums](http://anarchistcookbook.com/) for new, useful guides, or download it in PDF [here](http://anarchistscookbook.net/).

## What needs to be done

It would help to reformat the pages (usually not much more than renaming to .mdwn). Also, the txt files only have numbers as names, so rename them by following the [[index|index.txt]].

The pages may also need to be updated, but if you are making any changes, **copy the page to [[The Uncultured Anonymous]] first.** Since we are not affiliated with any known editors of the modern Anarchist's Cookbook, it would probably be best to make a seperate book rather than make unrecognized changes to an existing one.

## DISCLAIMER

This shit is really, really dangerous. Not only is some of it illegal, you could be injured or killed from following the directions incorrectly. Even worse, injury could occur by following incorrect directions (as the original author warns). Always think twice about what you are about to do, and check multiple sources, chemistry books, or just simple common sense before following this guide. You are wholly responsible for your actions after reading this book, and we, the authors, providers, and editors, cannot be sued for the aftermath.

**TL;DR: Always cross check guides FIRST, fix any problems/warn others of incorrect instructions, and don't sue us for your stupidity.**

## Letter from the author

I have recently been made aware of several websites that focus on The Anarchist Cookbook. As the author of the original publication some 30 plus years ago, it is appropriate for me to comment.

The Anarchist Cookbook was written during 1968 and part of 1969 soon after I graduated from high school. At the time, I was 19 years old and the Vietnam War and the so-called "counter culture movement" were at their height. I was involved in the anti-war movement and attended numerous peace rallies and demonstrations. The book, in many respects, was a misguided product of my adolescent anger at the prospect of being drafted and sent to Vietnam to fight in a war that I did not believe in.

I conducted the research for the manuscript on my own, primarily at the New York City Public Library. Most of the contents were gleaned from Military and Special Forces Manuals. I was not member of any radical group of either a left or right wing persuasion.

The central idea to the book was that violence is an acceptable means to bring about political change. I no longer agree with this.

Apparently in recent years, The Anarchist Cookbook has seen a number of 'copy cat' type publications, some with remarkably similar titles (Anarchist Cookbook II, III etc). I am not familiar with these publications and cannot comment upon them. I can say that the original Anarchist Cookbook has not been revised or updated in any way by me since it was first published.

During the years that followed its publication, I went to university, married, became a father and a teacher of adolescents. These developments had a profound moral and spiritual effect on me. I found that I no longer agreed with what I had written earlier and I was becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the ideas that I had put my name to. Shortly thereafter I wrote to Lyle Stuart Inc. explaining that I no longer held the views that were expressed in the book and requested that The Anarchist Cookbook be taken out of print. The response from the publisher was that the copyright was in his name and therefore such a decision was his to make - not the author's. In the early 1980's, the rights for the book were sold to another publisher. I have had no contact with that publisher (other than to request that the book be taken out of print) and I receive no royalties. 

Unfortunately, the book continues to be in print and with the advent of the Internet several websites dealing with it have emerged. I want to state categorically that I am not in agreement with the contents of The Anarchist Cookbook and I would be very pleased (and relieved) to see its publication discontinued. I consider it to be a misguided and potentially dangerous publication which should be taken out of print.

- *William Powell*
