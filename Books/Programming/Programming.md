I know how to MACHINE CODE.

## Programming Languages ##

Here are some programming languages worthy of mention. 
> _Note: Scripting languages are not the same as programming or markup languages. Take your hypertext elsewhere faggots_

* [[Assembly]]
* [[Bash]] - scripting language
* [[Batch]] - scripting language
* [[BBCODE]] **_EXPERT BBCODE PROGRAMMERS_**
* [[C|C-Tutorial]]
* [[C++]]
* [[C Sharp]] - see: [Java](/Java)
* [[Cobol]] - nobody uses this (why is it here)
* [[Java]]
* [[Haskell]] - you have to have four PhD's to be good at haskell
* [[Lisp]]
* [[LOLCODE]]
* [[mIRC Script]] (not a programming language)
* [[Perl]]
* [[Php]] 
* [[Python]]
* [[Qbasic]] (not a programming language)
* [[Ruby]] - In comparison with languages such as Python, Perl, and C, Ruby fucking sucks. (ruby can do what 100 lines of C can do in 3 with worthless built in functions though) [it will also take 4 hours longer]
* Visual Basic (real men do not program in this)

## So You Want To Learn To Program, eh? ##

Basically, before you start to learn anything, you're going to have to choose what you want to do with your 1337 skills, if you are interested in operating systems/hacking/cracking, then you should follow a path like this:

* [[C]]
* [[C++]]
* [[x86 Assembly]]
If you're more interested in web stuff/sploiting things, you should choose [Perl](/Perl) or [Python](/Python). If you want to make LOL GAEMS then you should just learn [C++](/C++), and if you're a comp sci nerd then [Haskell](/Haskell) or [Lisp](/Lisp) would be of interest to you.
_note:C#, Java, PHP, BASIC and Ruby are all [Shit](/Shit)_

## Tools ##

Pastebin's are a good way to share your code with other people so that they may give you advice / help debug your code if you are having problems.
