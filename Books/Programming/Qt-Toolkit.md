**Qt** is a cross-platform application development framework, widely used for the development of GUI programs, and, since the release of Qt 4, also used for developing non-GUI programs such as console tools and servers. Qt is most notably used in KDE, the web browser Opera (Linux/FreeBSD/Solaris versions), Google Earth, Skype, Qtopia and OPIE. It is produced by the Norwegian company Trolltech, formerly Quasar Technologies. Trolltech insiders pronounce Qt as "cute".
