Now that the Partyvan /i/nsurgency W/i/ki is back up, updated, with a new skin, and on a stable host, all that remains is to continually make it useful in order to increase traffic.

=Things to Do=
These are the things that must be done in order to maintain relevance.

==Traffic Related==
These are things that need to specifically be followed to increase w/i/ki traffic

===Record Raids===
This means browse the /i/ boards, and 4chan's /b/, for raids.  When an interesting one appears--one with an achievable goal and sufficient interest--make a raid page.  Use the other front-page raids as a template, copying where necessary.  Below are some useful templates:

* [[Template:Standard/Dox]]
* [[Template:Raid Infobox]]
* [[Template:Standard/Notices]]
* [[Template:Standard/LinkBox]]

====What this Means====
# Create the sidebar thingie (Raid Infobox) with links to IRC (simply make a room on Helldive for it, or keep it at #insurgency)
# Use the dox template to record any dox found in the thread or pastebins or whatnot
# Provide sections for screencaps of win, quote faggotry, etc.
# Make it look pretty with pictures
# Create a section of specific raid plans, links to relevant pages (like [[Ruination]] or [[Ruin Life Tactics/Free Shit]]), etc
# [Maybe] ask [[User:Hitlerlol]] to make the page edits anonymous to promote contributing

===Divert Raids===
When a page has been created, and is useful, divert traffic to it.  This means spam the raid on 4chan's /b/ (along with information on why it is useful), on /i/, and especially in the threads--doubly when it can function as an answer to a question.  Tell people not to use tinychat (it really is fucking stupid), and explain that the w/i/ki is more tolerant to things like dox or borderline-legal issues than is ED (not to mention that obscurity is our friend to a degree).
* 4chan has a LOT of banned URLs, so make sure to obfuscate the link somehow (like add a lot of (?R3(((\/0v3!!!) inside the URL.

Also check to make sure people in the IRC channel are familiar with the raid page.

==Content Related==
We need more content and more of it needs to be relevant.  Also see [[/i/nsurgency W/i/ki:Community portal]].

===Update the front page===
Jesus Hitler Christ, we need to update the front page REGULARLY.  This means the news section, past raids, current raids, and the list of tutorials and tools.  A list of these templates can be found [[/i/nsurgency W/i/ki:Maintenence|here]].

===Tutorial Drive Summer 2010===
Tutorials on legally dubious things are what largely make us useful.  Needless to say, we need more.  Post here to inform others of what tutorials you are writing.

====Tutorials Wanted====
There are some things specifically that we could use:

* An overhaul of [[Denial of Service Methods]]
* Better SQL injection tutorial
* How to spot spais

===Programs===
Right now there are dozens of DDoS programs on here, many of them redundant.  What we '''really''' need is for someone(s) to make a single tool that handles everything, is easy for newfags to use, and has a nice w/i/ki page.  That said, DDoS tools should remain a secondary offensive at most.
