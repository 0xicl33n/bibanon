## File Formats

Because we will be archiving a variety of formatted materials which MUST stay readable and easily convertible in the near future, we'll make a preliminary list of what formats need to be used on the wiki.

### Documents

* Wiki Markup Language: **Markdown**
  * Markdown is an easily readable markup language that helps makes text files not only readable, but parsable. Since it's the most common non-html markup, all articles should be converted to this format. 
* General text: **.md, .txt**
  * It's strongly recommended that all general text files (READMEs, Pastebin dump) be in the Markdown format, so that they can easily read and parsed as wikipages on this wiki. The file extension should be .txt outside the wiki (for Windows compatibility), and .md within the wiki.

### Image formats

* Lossy compression: **JPEG**
  * Lossy compression is used for real-life pictures that do not need as much info for the eye.
* Lossless compression: **PNG**
  * For any images with text, lines, computer screenshots, or vector graphics. Should also be used when transparency is needed.
* Animations: **GIF**
  * The current standard for animated images. It's getting very old and has a limited color palette, and was already replaced by PNG in static images.
  * Alternative: **APNG**
    * An addon to the PNG format that gives animation abilities in addition the the existing abilities of GIF. It's supported well in Firefox, but not at all in other browsers or image viewers.
    * If we implement this [APNG compatibility library](https://github.com/davidmz/apng-canvas) in [[Gollum]], the images will animate fine in IE9, Chrome, and Safari. 

### Audio

* Lossy compression: **OGG**
  * A common MP3 alternative that has built-in support in all browsers (with the exception of IE, which needs VLC installed). Reasons against MP3 is that it is a patented format with lawyers actively pursuing royalties for it's use.
