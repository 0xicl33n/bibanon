## Interview with Misaki Ito

Q. Could you tell us your first impression when you read the original story?
A. The first impression is that, uh, it is a true story and I was attracted by the fact that there was such love story and I thought it's really nice. It gives me a supportive push.

Q. What do you think about Hermes?
A. In the story of Densha Otoko, she is a kind of a woman as if an elder sister who leads Densha otoko. In the drama that is the big appeal, as Hermes is being the major player, um, in another world, I'm a type of person who describes that.

Q. What did you talk about with the director in preparation for the role?
A. She is originally a lady who works at a foreign-capitalized company and is really pure and has a natural mindset (goofy a little bit). But I should not highlight it directly, in reverse, as she has a trauma in a part of her heart from a past fault in her romance. While I seek for the way to describe the condition, I not only describe it but also depict her goofiness. It's difficult for me a little bit, as she looks like a kind of person who has no consideration but in fact she conceals a truly shocking event in her mind. Checking it up step by step, I'm performing every line carefully.

Q. It's a worthwhile role, isn't it?
A. Yes, it is a worthwhile role. I'm thinking in my mind that how much I should put myself out.

Q. Could you tell me the impression of Atsushi Ito?
A. As I saw Ito-kun in person, he devotes himself for his works and he is sober. With such a perspective, he has a character near his role, I see him that way.

Q. What do you talk about with him on the job site?
A. With Atsushi-kun*, actually I practiced the lines by making dialogues and talked about the characters' sentiment in detail as describing specific scenes,

* Japanese people usually don't call first name in public. Therefore, you can say that she has a sense of familiarity with him.

Q. He performed an otaku amazingly, didn't he?
A. Yeah, actually. The other day, we went Akibahara and filmed on the location, he fitted in the town perfectly and he knows his way around it. I heard that he attends a university near the town. He told me that as he know the area well, I will tell you good restaurants and good shops which offer value price.

Q. How is the atmosphere of the job site?
A. Basically, it's a love comedy. The comedy parts are highlighted and the director devotes himself into the work and he is very funny. It's like we are following him. We have strong solidarity since the first scene of the first episode. There are words used in 2 channel like, moe～, kita～. He uses those words combined with the words, "check, OK," "Hey guys, ready" used in the film industry like --- "kitaa," "O.K. moee."

Q. What are you looking forward in the shooting?
A. Well, as Tsuyoshi and Saori just made conversations by telephone or email in the episode 1 and 2, they are trying to know each other, they are wondering about their personality respectively and started liking each other. It is phase they start holding a little torch in their heart.
The episode 3 starts the scene that they meet in person for the first time. I'm looking forward to the story after around the scene.

Q. Isn't it nice in the scene with 3 female persons?
A. Yuko and Kaho have quick tempo (literal translation). They are people who continue talking all the way along and there is Saori. She lives in her world. She is a type of person who answers in off tempo when asked about something, at the same time, she is a type of person whom people want to support.

## Message to audience

Um, as surely succeeding good points of the original book and the movie, Hermes plays the major role only in the drama, she meet Densha otoko while she holds a mental trauma, she walks forward with Densha otoko step by step. This is a piece of work I'd like to cheer up her. Please watch the drama looking forward to the episodes respectively.
