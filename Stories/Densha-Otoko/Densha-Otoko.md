"[Densha Otoko, or 'Train Man'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Densha_Otoko) is the name of a very popular book published in Japan in early 2005, which tells the true story of a nerdy guy who falls in love with a girl who he saved from a drunk on a train. This entire story takes place on a Japanese bulletin board system called [[2ch]], or 'ni-channel', particularly in a thread called 'Men Being Shot from Behind', where single men get together and gripe about being single.

In typical Japanese fashion, after the tremendous success of the book, both a movie version and a TV drama series were released. 'Densha Otoko' is really the "it" book of 2005 for Japan. It's a really great story and I hope that this translation helps you enjoy it, too."

Now if only someone did the same thing for the [[Damaged Goods]] or [[Blindmute Loli]] stories...

What do we do now? We need the translation. I guess we're going to have to be renegade archivists like the [Archive Team](http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Main_Page), if we want to save anything.

And if shit hits the fan and we haven't prepared, [we'll be these guys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvfwxa1Nwi0&feature=related).
