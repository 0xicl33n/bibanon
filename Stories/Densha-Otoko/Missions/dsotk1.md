> "Densha Otoko" - The Train Man - Mission.1 - A Call For Help - "dinnerwhere help"

When it was all over, a certain resident of the BBS spoke. "I'll admit it. At first I underestimated Train Man. He whined and cried over a little thank you phone call, so I thought we all had to step in and show him some support. But now Train is lightyears ahead of me..." The Train Man, who showed courage on a train. Can he show it outside of the train, as well?

Did you get a girlfriend?

No, but maybe my luck is changing...
Answering like that makes this sound like it's made-up, but...
Anyway, you guyz, go outside once in awhile

738 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/14 21:35

Sorry, now that I think about it, my luck isn't changing... ＿|￣|○

Akihabara

749 Name: 731 Date: 04/03/14 21:55

Today I went to Akihabara. I didn't have anything specific I wanted to buy, but...
On the train ride home there was a drunk old man on the train.
Almost everyone in our car was women, except for me, who was sitting, and the old man, who was hanging from the hand-rails.
They were all between 20 - 40, I guess.

The old man started getting in the faces of the women around him.
At first he was messing with a younger woman, but she was very straightforward,
hollered at the old man, and then got off at the very next station.
During all this, I keep glancing at him out of the corner of my eye, thinking what an annoyance he was causing.

Next the old man comes to the seat I'm on, goes straight to the middle part of it
and starts yelling at the older women who're sitting there.
"You'd better not even think about using a cell phone, you got it!?"
he goes, trying to scare them.
The women were like（´･ω･`)←all quiet

I think this is going to get long...

763 Name: 731 Date: 04/03/14 22:15

>>761
I don't know if it will turn into anything, but...
If only I'd had more courage...

I'll write it now. Kalm down, self!

766 Name: 731 Date: 04/03/14 22:23

The women just sat their with their eyes on the floor,
like they were thinking 'it's best not to get involved'.
But the old man started yelling about some ridiculous thing,
like "Women should just shut up and let the men do their thing!"
and he grabs the women's faces in his hands and pinches their cheeks hard.
I figured it was only going to get worse, so I pulled together all my courge and yelled:
"Hey, cut it out!" I'm sure my voice was shaking.
I'd never been in a fight or anything before.
But it seemed like the man hadn't heard me - he didn't react.
"Hey, I'm talking to you! I said cut it tragakjfgs,gnmsfg!"
I yelled once again, desperately. The women were like "No, it's okay, it's alright"
to me, when I started to get to my feet. Finally the man seemed to notice,
and turned towards me.
"Lookin' at me from the corner of yer eyes..."
he spat, glaring at me.

He stumbled towards my seat.
"Yeah, and just how old are ya?"
"22!"
"Yeah? Well I'm ovefrer 60 youknoww."
I couldn't really tell what he was saying, but I figured it was something like "shut up, you dumb kid, what do you know"
"What, what, you wanna fight?"
He was already hunched over in a fighting pose.
"Huh? What are you talking about? I'll call the police."
"Well then call the police; call whoeevvererraff"
Mumbling, he started swinging his fists.
His aim seemed to be off, because his hand hit one of the women sitting next to me.
Well, actually it was more like it slid past her...


How can I make this shorter...? （´･ω:;.:...

772 Name: 731 Date: 04/03/14 22:37

The woman shrieked and flinched backward.
Without even realizing what I was doing, I stood up and grabbed both the old man's arms.
During that time I saw one of the women go to get the train attendant.

Then, a 20-something businessman from the next car over noticed the commotion
and came to help. He saw me and the old man struggling
and grabbed the man from behind, trapping his arms.
"Okay, okay, leave the poor kid alone."
He's definitely had a longer life than I have. He knows how to calm someone down without making them mad.
"I've got him; you sit down."
I was pretty worked up by then, so the businessman ended up having to calm me down, too.
The old man didn't try to threaten the businessman at all.
Maybe he knew that the businessman was stronger.
It kinda pisses me off to think that he was underestimating me so much... ヽ(`Д´)ﾉ

When I sat down, the woman next to me said to me
"What an annoyance he is."
"He really is."
Say something more interesting, self! ＿|￣|○


I'm tired... ＿|￣|○

779 Name: 731 Date: 04/03/14 22:52

>>767
That's really what it was like.
I was so lame.
The businessman was so cool.


Soon the train attendant came.
"Well, we'll take him to the police for the time being, so please get off at the next station."
and the old man starts yelling again.

They were going to file a report, so at the next station
the woman next to me, the older women, the old man and I got off the train.
and then the train attendant says
"I'll go find a policeman; could you keep him under control for a few minutes, please?"
and disappears. I'm left with the old man and the women. How undependable, I think.
I'm grabbing the man's arm so he can't run away, but he yells
"Quit grabbin' me; I ain't runnin' away!"
and tries to pull away. The people around me didn't help me at all... (´･ω･`)

I was there trying to keep the old man, who kept trying to run away, under control
when finally 2 or 3 policemen came.
"This the guy?"
they ask me. I answer yes, and they drag him to the stationmaster's room with a gusto.
We all follow.
There, once they checked all our IDs
they asked the women "would you like to file a report?"
but they all said
"no, that's okay".
I told them that he hadn't really done anything to me.

780 Name: 731 Date: 04/03/14 23:06

Even though we didn't file a report, it seems there had to be some paperwork done, so
the women and I ended up following them to the police box.
On the way there I apologized to the women
"I'm so sorry for getting you involved in this mess."
The women should have all gotten off at a stop further down the line...
"It's alright."
they smiled.

When we got to the police box, the old man was taken to the back room.
I could hear him yelling, and the angry shouts of the policemen.
"We'll wring the liquor out of him nice and slow *laughs*"
said one policeman, smiling.

I see the women scribbling out some kind of questionaire(?)
and am overcome by the urge to apologize again.
I bowed to them over and over again, apologizing.
All I could think at the time was that if only I'd kept my mouth shut,
we wouldn't be having to go through all this.
"There aren't many young men like you nowadays,"
said one of the women to me. I felt like I'd been saved.


Just a little more.
The ending has already been given away, but...

789 Name: 731 Date: 04/03/14 23:24

I don't know what I was thinking.
"Um, may I go home, now?"
I asked the policeman.
"Yes, you may. Thank you very much."
he thanked me. The women all bowed deeply to me, as well.
"Thank you"
they said.
"If you wouldn't mind, may I have your address?"
said one of the older women.
I wrote my name and address in her memo pad.
"Um... may I have it, too?"
so I wrote it for the woman who had been sitting next to me, too.
That's when
"You must let me thank you properly sometime."
she says. I freak out and go
"Oh, no, no, that's okay"
and she says
"Well then, thank you again, really."
And I practically ran away.


That's the end.
I thought of this afterwards, but
why didn't I ask her for her address, too... ＿|￣|○
I've never had a woman feel appreciation for me before...
I totally freaked ouuuuutttttt~~~~~~

792 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/14 23:27

>>789
You told her your address, right?
I think she'll send a thank you to your house, so don't worry.

Speaking of which, do you have a heated table, stuffed animals everywhere
and a tiny computer screen?

793 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/14 23:27

Well, all that's happened is she's added your name to a big collection of men's addresses!
Even that's a brilliant achievement, tho ＿|￣|○

811 Name: 731 Date: 04/03/14 23:40

So many things today that I'm not used to... I'm exhausted... ＿|￣|○
Thanks for reading this huge long post; you guyz rawk.
In the event that she does contact me, I'll post about it here. (`･ω･´)

>>805
I wanted to, too, but the only other passengers were women...(´･ω･`)

The businessman was like a god to me...
If it weren't for him, I'd have been dead meat.
I think it was really obvious how disgraceful I am...

See you. *leaves*

812 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/14 23:42

I think it's impressive that 731 stood up to a drunk.
It's not like I was there or anything, but...

That's above and beyond civic duty, don't you think?

815 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/14 23:45

>>811
Good work. ur awesome for acting on ur courage.
If there's any new developments, be sure to let us know.

762 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/15 19:08

Thanks for listening yesterday.
It's the day after yesterday, but no action so far.
As for descriptions of the older women and the woman sitting next to me
it's all kinda foggy so I can't go into too much detail, is that okay?

The older women:
I'm pretty sure all three of them were in their forties.
But they had an upperclass feel to them.

The woman sitting next to me:
Probably in her twenties. But she seemed older than me. Maybe about 22-25.
Which celebrity does she look like...? I... I don't know any celebrities... ＿|￣|○
Long, dark brown hair, slender build.
But not too flashy, not too plain, just a nice, calm, lovely young woman.

777 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/15 19:27

>>772
I'm your average anime otaku, game otaku, Akihabara geek... ＿|￣|○
Age = years without a girlfriend
Of course, I'm a virgi(trunkated)

But I'll do my best.
Give me that courage once more...

Even on the one-in-a-million chance that anything were to happen between the woman sitting next to me and myself,
we haven't got a thing in common, I bet... ＿|￣|
I could never even walk through the city streets with her

778 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/15 19:28

>>777
Congrats! Three sevens.
You had a head in the second line, but it was cut off in the tenth - LOL

＿　　|　　￣　　　　|..............○))
In my mind it was more like this, though...


>>780
Of course, at the time I thought "this is my big chance!"

Save her
↓
The women feel grateful
↓
Maybe get a thank you present
↓
tell this BBS right away
↓
(ﾟдﾟ)great story...

Well, if anything else happens I'll post it here. *leaves*

> None of the BBS residents, including Train Man himself, were really expecting anything worth posting to happen. However. The first change came wrapped in a box.

Air raid alert! Air raid alert!
Train Man is in formation and closing in!!

623 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/16 19:43

Hello. The other thread sent me over here.

Just now, a package was delivered via private delivery service with a gift and thank you note from the young woman.
The gift is a teacup. The note's contents were a thank you.
She wrote "I was sitting next to you on the train when it all happened", so I know it's her.

The stationary, envelope and writing are all adorable! (;ﾟ∀ﾟ)=３ wow!!!
I get the feeling it even smells nice... (;´Д｀) *pant pant*
This is bad; my face feels all hot. Kalm down, self!

624 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 19:45

>>623
Kalm down, the scent is an illusion *LOL*
Does the letter say anything about a next time?

625 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 19:45

>>623
Hey, if it was delivered by a private delivery service, does that mean you've got her phone number?

628 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/16 19:52

>>624
A next time...?
Well, to quote:
"I was so moved by your bravery."
That's about it...

>>625
It's written on the sales slip... (((( ;ﾟдﾟ))) awowowow

This is where you pull together your courage again, huh.

643 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/16 20:00

I can't...
I don't know which way is up any more...

I can't call a woman on the phone... ＿|￣|○

650 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/16 20:03

I seriously don't know what to do, here!! ヽ(`Д´)ﾉ
Do I call her right now?! SGklsrngslknslr

653 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 20:04

It'd be too rude to suddenly call her up, don't you think?
But this is a difficult situation... if you aren't a little forceful, you can't hope to get anywhere.
Why don't you write her back and say something like "This must be fate. Will you have dinner with me?"

656 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 20:06

＞Train Man.
Wait. How many cups did she send?

661 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 20:11

Here's some advice from someone who used to hang out on the Couples BBS.

The phone. CALL HER ZOMG.
Just pretend you wanted to let her know it arrived.

Thanx for the wonderful cups, or something like that - compliment her taste.

Then you change the topic, like, So, do you ride that train line often?

665 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/16 20:13

You guyz... thanks, seriously

>>660
There were two cups.
My spec data...?
In a word: ＿|￣|○

I've got my cell phone in one hand, but I can't dial...
This takes even more courage than before... (´･ω･`)

668 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 20:15

>>665
The later it gets, the harder it will be to call.
I think you should call her before nine at the latest.

669 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 20:16

>>665
＿|￣|○ doesn't mean anything to me. Age, salary, car, family situation, looks, or something like that...

So there WERE two cups. Use that. Got it?

678 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 20:21

At this point in time it's impossible to ask her to be your girlfriend,
so for now you should just set it up so you can contact her again later.

Example conversation:
"Thank you for the gift - the cups were delivered today.
They're a lovely design. But why did you send two of them? *LOL*
I'm single, so I'll only ever have a chance to use one of them! *LOL*
So where do they sell cups like these?
I'd like to go and see, so would you mind giving me directions...?"
Like that?


I'm a poisonous single so I can't think of anything else.

680 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 20:21

call her and say thank you omg!!
liiiiike
thank you for the cups; you really shouldn't have.
the other day was quite a disaster, wasn't it. as a man, i just couldn't let someone get away with such behavior.
appeal to her with your morality and strength.

687 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 20:25

Usually you'd reply with a letter, right?
I think a sudden phone call will scare her away.
Especially if it's a sudden phone call on the DAY the letter arrives, anyone would be scared off.

688 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/16 20:25

Waaaaa━━━━━｡ﾟ(ﾟ´Д｀ﾟ)ﾟ｡━━━━━aaaahhh!!!
Thanx you guyz!
I'll take all your advice to heart!

>>669
age: 22
Salary: about $30-$40k?
family situation: average
no car
looks: like a nerd from Akihabara _|￣|○

Do people normally say "won't you have a drink with me?" when they receive two cups?
There's no way I can do that!!

I've been gripping the phone for awhile now, but I just can't do it......
Is tomorrow okay...? (´･ω･`)

690 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 20:25

Is the phone number on the sales slip a home phone? Or a cell phone?

695 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 20:27

>>688
If yer gonna call, do it today!
There's no time like the present!

698 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 20:27

I'm telling you, a phone call will scare her away.
You should leave her with a good impression of you.

707 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/16 20:30

If I can't get myself to call her before 9pm,
I'll give up... (´･ω･`)

I'm too worked up right now...
I bet she'd be able to hear me panting through my nose...

709 Name: 678 Date: 04/03/16 20:31

I've been recommending that you call her for awhile now,
but there's a reason for it.

If you go with a letter, you respond and that's it, finished.
I don't think there's much chance of it leading to anything.

If you want something to come of it, your only chance is to fight til the last man and call her!!


>>698
If it were me, I really think I'd call.

710 Name: 680 Date: 04/03/16 20:31

well, i'm a woman and if someone called me i wouldn't be scared away... i'd think "ah, the cups arrived. what a conscientious person, to call and say thank you", and have a good impression.

724 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 20:37

I'm a woman, too,
and I think a phone call and a letter are both fine.
But, if the person suddenly tried to force a conversation on me, I'd be really turned off.
Why don't you call her and plan your offensive based on her reaction?

Either way I vote for a multi-stage attack.

726 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/16 20:37

I've been staring back and forth between this thread and my phone for a couple minutes now...
But I can't do it...

734 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 20:41

dammit, now MY heart's pounding, too

736 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 20:41

>>726
Even if it doesn't work out right now, you don't really have anything to lose!
You've already gotten the teacups, right?
If you fail you're just right back where you started!
Go! If you call yourself a man, get your wits together!

737 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 20:41

seriously, this is where you pull your courage together.

738 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 20:42

I can't tell if Train Man is brave or spineless lol
Go for it, dammit! Train! Train! Traingrfgsflgsflkfsgsfklg!!!11

739 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 20:43

>>726
You stupid bastard!
Right now your manhood is being tested！
What are you doing backing down?!
Prepare for death and pick up the phone!
RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!

741 Name: 680 Date: 04/03/16 20:43

she doesn't have a bad impression of Train Man, so i think she'll accept a phone call pretty easily.

or a thank you note, of course.

but like someone else said, with a note, there won't be anything else after that; i agree with the opinion that you should call her before it all cools over.

you know, it doesn't even have to be today - tomorrow's not too late!

750 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 20:47

Call her today!
If you wait til tomorrow, I can tell that
you'll end up going 'I'm too busy today; I'll call her tomorrow', and never end up calling her at all!

Got it!? C A L L H E R T O D A Y ! ! ! ! ! ! !

757 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 20:50

You're at a fork in the road of your life right now!
Think long and hard before making a move!

762 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 20:53

If you don't call, it will end with her thinking "he was a nice person, wasn't he...".
That's a fact.
"I'm so happy that such a wonderful woman thinks highly of me~~"
And really, it's fine if it ends like that.
If Train was me, maybe that'd be what he's thinking.
But you know,
that young lady picked out cups J U S T . F O R . Y O U ?

763 Name: 680 Date: 04/03/16 20:53

why don't you just decide to call her tomorrow, and then do a simulation talking to me?

i'll give you advice, too.

782 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/16 21:01

I pulled my concentration together and tried to call her, over and over again.
But it was no use.

My heart's pounding even harder than it was on the train.
My palms are sweaty, my face is burning up, and my heartbeat is deafening

I'm a failure, after all... ＿|￣|○
I don't suppose a letter would work? (´･ω･`)

783 Name: 680 Date: 04/03/16 21:01

i'm not just saying this, i really will help.

im waiting for train man's reaction.

if you want to try a simulation then gimme your addy

or i can give you mine

832 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/16 21:18

Everyone, thanx so much
But I just can't do it...
My hands are shaking

I'm gonna write a letter..

836 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 21:19

UR having a hard time, Train Man

840 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 21:19

>>832
everyone's hands shake at first.
mine did, too. but you know what? you know what?
today is the first one.
on the next one, your hands won't shake any more.
you're going up a step.

861 Name: ♀ Date: 04/03/16 21:26

I think you should call, too.
There's no "next time" with a letter.
What are you planning AFTER the thank you note?
If she doesn't answer you, it's over.

Even with relatives, it's polite to call and say "it arrived, thank you"
Just repeat that kind of thing to yourself!

864 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 21:28

I think if he makes the phone call right now, Train Man will be changed forever, you know?
It doesn't matter if he goes out with her or not,
I think he'll end up gaining something much more important.

874 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/16 21:31

My hands won't mooooovveee!! ヽ(`Д´)ﾉwaaahh
Give me even more courage than before!

I'm calling it quits for today... ＿|￣|○
Let me read everyone's opinions carefully, then make preparations tomorrow...

910 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 21:39

>>904
I'm just gonna say one thing.
"She's just one person, but you've got all of 2ch behind you."

That's it.

927 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/16 21:42

It all just made me cry, kinda...
You guyz are so nice and I'm such a waste...
Can't I even say one little thank you...?

928 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 21:43

GYAAHHHHHHH GOFORITGOFORITGOFORITGOFORIT

929 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 21:43

Thank her with your actions!

949 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/16 21:48

For the time being, I'm going to try to get a log of this thread together as best I can,
and decide what I want to say to her tomorrow...
Thanx you guyz. Sorry for being such a loser.

I've never been so nervous in my life...
I'm exhausted... ＿|￣|○

2 cups has gotta be an invitation

47 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 22:13

And who gives teacups to an Akihabara nerd?
That makes me read something into it.

48 Name: 680 from the previous thread Date: 04/03/16 22:14

it's normal to give mugs and cups in sets of two.
i don't think anything is meant by it.

i'm going back to being nameless now. (･∀･) *leaves*

50 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 22:14

>>45
Yeah. There's gotta be lots of single cups... why'd she choose a pair, I wonder?
It's a bad idea to read too much into it, but it gives you ideas, huh.

55 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 22:16

No seriously, nobody would send just one cup.

56 Name: 724 from the other thread Date: 04/03/16 22:17

I agree with 680.
Sending a set is normal.
Also choosing to send teacups was prolly because they're a safe choice.

57 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 22:17

It's customary to send cups as a pair.

58 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/16 22:17

I'm thinking the same thing as everyone else...

Could it be...? No, no way... in an endless loop

66 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/16 22:20

Oh... so it really is a good idea to not read into it, huh...
But I'd better make these a family heirloom...

85 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 22:26

There's no meaning in the cups, okay?
Maybe you're just seeing thing where there's nothing?
I think it's safe thing to choose as a thank you gift, tho

---

> The BBS residents run rampant reading into the fact that there are two cups. Then, 89's casual comment brings a torrent to the thread.

89 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 22:27

>>85
Reading too much into the cups?
Maybe you can tell a little bit by what brand they are? Has someone brought this up already?

93 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 22:28

Even other dinnerware...
With a thank you like this, plates, glasses or silverware would be weird, too.
Maybe teacups were just the most suitable thing?

99 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 22:30

>>89
I think you're thinking too much of it
One time I needed to send a thank you gift so I asked for opinions from the people around me
and a lot of people said cups, then, too

115 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/16 22:35

It might be annoying if I keep saying this, but I can't say it enough
thank you so so much for thinking through all this stuff
just for someone like me!

>>104
It says
HERMES
I wonder what brand that is?

>>103
thank u so much...
if I can get up the courage, I'll take you up on that

117 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 22:35

HERMES, yeaahhhhhhhhhhhh!

121 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 22:36

>>115
Hey! That's pronounced 'Ermes'! You must have heard of it!

122 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 22:36

Whoa, whoa, Hermes?
The lady has money to burn...

126 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 22:36

>>115
HERMES is a brand name: Hermes
And not the one Lala rides, either, got it?

127 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 22:37

Hey, these cups have meaning, after all!!!!!

132 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/16 22:38

Hermes? The one who makes purses and stuff?
Then these are a brand name product...
Are they expensive?
They make kitchenware?

No matter how grateful you are, nobody sends Hermes, seriouslyyyy

149 Name: 68 Date: 04/03/16 22:40

Hermes is pretty incredible... she's got good sense to send out something so nice as a thank you.

152 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 22:41

All of a sudden we're heating |_| P

155 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 22:41

You gotta call her tomorrow for sure
For sure, for sure, really for sure
I won't tell you not to get your hopes up any more
don't think about anything; just call

164 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/16 22:43

Hey you guyz, don't scare me!
My heart is pounding again

167 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 22:44

Woooow, coooool.
But I dunno if she's got feelings for you...
Like 68 said, she might just be well brought-up.
There's no doubt she's really truly grateful, tho, huh.

Now you definitely have to call and say thank you.

182 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 22:47

He's gotta take her out to eat to say thank you, now

183 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/16 22:47

185 Name: 68 Date: 04/03/16 22:48

Thanks to the high-class Hermes cups, it just got easier for something to come of this!

"I couldn't possibly accept something so valuble - I'd feel horrible... I'm so sorry.
Won't you let me take you out to dinner, as a thank you for the cups?"

would be pretty natural.
If someone said that to me, I'd go.

234 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/16 22:59

I'd better call today, then...

244 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 23:01

see? time up.
after 11pm is couples-time... he wrote, and made himself depressed

253 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/16 23:03

I called her cell, but got her voicemail...
I'll try again tomorrow...

More than anything I just wanted to say thank you.
Even if she doesn't call me back tomorrow,
I'll call her!

297 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/16 23:12

since my junior high speech contest...

398 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/17 22:29

I wonder what Train Man is talking about on the phone right now...

401 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/17 22:29

Okay, the first part just ended
My hands are still shaking

It seems she just drew a bath
Hermes sounded willing to keep talking,
but I volunteered and said that after was fine

It seems she's going to call back after her bath.

Oh no, now I'm nervous...

406 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/17 22:30

Good job!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

413 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/17 22:30

I can't invite her to dinner!

432 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/17 22:33

First of all I apologized for not leaving a message yesterday
and for calling back so late today
and for not being able to answer even though she called so many times
and sorry for accepting such a wonderful gift
and for troubling her that day

I apologized for everything...
All I did was apologize... _|￣|○

I think this would be a pretty standard choice.
What do you think about 'Tsuki no Shizuku'? It's pretty popular among young women.

ttp://www.sankofoods.com/shop.html

686 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/17 23:08

No way, ladies

If you go somewhere too gutsy on the first date, then you're stuck for the next tiiiiiime.
Someplace with good alcohol and good food, not too expensive but not too cheap, not too much but not too little
is what I think is your safest chooooooice

690 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/17 23:08

>>683
How bout Italian food or French
If you look online there's all sorts
Ask a guy at your office who looks like he's popular with the ladies,
or go look on community bulletin boards near where you live

If you're a nerd from Akihabara then act like it! Use electronics omg!!

691 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/17 23:08

http://www.diamond-dining.com/atcafe/index.html
this kind of place
is slightly fashionable right now

692 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/17 23:08

Sushi shops, family restaurants, Korean BBQ, noodle shops are taboo,
Someplace she'd be happy to be invited to is like a light Italian place; someplace that won't make her feel too out of place!

693 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/17 23:08

I'm a woman, but...
Something too trendy like French food would scare me away
'Tsuki no Shizuku' or something like a nice bar or ethnic place would be relaxing and nice, I think

The first time she called me
was at about noon. I wanted to leave work early,
so I skipped my lunch break. I didn't notice the voicemail
until about an hour later. I called her back right away,
but couldn't get ahold of her. She called again at 3pm.
I was working again and couldn't answer.
She called again at 5pm and 7pm,
but I couldn't answer. I suck.

101 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/17 23:42

So, I got home a little after 10pm. I called right away.
I think the first things we said were
"Hello, this is Train; am I speaking to Miss Hermes?"
"Ah, I finally got ahold of you."
or something like that.

"I'm sorry I've been so tough to get ahold of.
Thank you for calling back so many times."
"Oh, no, I'm sorry for having such bad timing."

After that
"The cups arrived.
Thank you for such a wonderful gift."
"Oh, not at all."
We talked about that, and about that time on the train

Ugh, I don't remember much about it all... ＿|￣|

105 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/17 23:43

>>101
It sounds like it was going really well

116 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/17 23:49

Me
"I'm so sorry for inconveniencing you the other day
and for taking up so much of your time"

H
"It's really alright."

Me
"I even went home before everyone else..."

H
"We went home right after you did.
The other ladies and I talked a little bit about you, too *laughs*

Me
"Eh?!"

H
"We all said what a brave young man you are."

We really used more words to talk about it,
but that was the feeling of what we meant...

120 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/17 23:50

Great, greeaaaaattt

139 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/17 23:54

At this point I hear a voice that sounded like her mother from far off
"Aren't you going to take a bath?"

H
"Pardon me a moment." (She probably covered the receiver with her hand, and:)
"Later!"

Me
"We can talk later, if you'd like."

H
"Thank you. Well, then, I'll call you back, alright?"
(I didn't ask at first if she was able to talk right now)

And then I hurried back to this thread

146 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/17 23:56

Train may be an ugly nerd from Akihabara, but he's got the courage of a certified hottie
SO KEWLLLLL

('A｀) I'm gross AND a chicken; maybe I should be pulled along with Train Man...

161 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/18 00:01

The phone rang

H "I'm sorry for making you wait."

Me "That was really fast."

H "I take quick baths."

Me "I'm sorry; I made you hurry."

H "It's okay."

I was trying not to make her feel bad
or at least I think that's how it sounded...

I'm thinking about how I can
steer the conversation towards inviting her to dinner

55 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/17 23:33

I want to know which model from this list Hermes looks like P L E A S E ＞Train Man

187 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/18 00:08

>>55
There's nobody on that list who looks like her,
but the general feel of her is closer to the bottom of the site...

>>79
Her specs, which celebrity does she look like? ＞ I don't know any celebrities...
Meeting place, tell me where so I can check it out ＞ I live along the Keihin Touhoku Line
ur specs, height, weight, build, normal attire? ＞ ＿|￣|

201 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/18 00:12

>>198
If you're an Akihabara nerd, then you wear jeans and a flannel shirt or something?
Do you own a dinner jacket, at least?

215 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/18 00:16

>>201
That's exactly right.
Plus glasses. What's "outerwear"? （´・ω:;.:...

I'll skip through the progression of it
Here's the result

We're going out to dinner,
but we'll decide the place and time later

228 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/18 00:19

>>215
Okay, leave it to me, I used to dress like that too, so it'll be fine

Do you have any jeans that are straight and tight? If you do, go with that.
For your top, a light turtleneck and a simple jacket is fine.
I'll go see if I can Google up a sample

237 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/18 00:21

You know, at a time like this, I think you should go a little stylish?

If you don't change your outfit and get some self-confidence, it'll be hard to go into the restaurant, right?

238 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/18 00:21

At the very least, you should:
- cut your hair properly
- iron out your wrinkly clothes
- no mussy hair

I don't know what your hair looks like right now, but I think you should go get clean-cut, at any rate.

239 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/18 00:21

Thanks everyone...
I'll go buy clothes.

I don't have any acne right now

269 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/18 00:26

For now I'll list the sites that I used when I escaped from my otaku phase...
Give it some consideration, okay.

I know you're all thinking of all this for my sake,
Forgive me...

300 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/18 00:33

Train, don't be swayed by the opinions around you!
Everyone's rooting for you, so give your own opinions
first priority when you consider everyone's responses!

Anyway, good work for today

301 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/18 00:33

I'm sure you're panicking, but it's a good thing

399 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/18 00:53

I sympathize with Train as I read this thread,
but it's really hard to get a woman, huh
I don't think I'd ever be able to do it
The hurdles I have to clear are high and many

410 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/18 00:55

>>399
But in Train's case, it's "easier done than said", huh...
Someone who really thought at the beginning that he wouldn't be able to take her to dinner, *leaves*

556 Name: female 1 Date: 04/03/18 10:01

Train Man, how did you invite her to dinner?
Here's some calm advice from a lone girl to Train Man:
Sorry if it's off.

"Thanks for the cups. They're really expensive, aren't they?"
= showing her that you're impressed with her for sending Hermes
Also, letting her casually see that you don't know much about name brands

"Miss OOO, what kind of restaurant do you usually go to?"
= "What shall we eat?" is too straightforward, you see
But more importantly if you check her tastes with this kind of question
it'll be easy to come up with conversation on the day of the dinner.
If her response is something that's out of your territory,
say "Oh, I see... I never really have a chance to go to that sort of place,
so I don't have any ideas of which restaurant to go to. Do you know a good one?"
You can always leave the choice to her.
If she's unwilling to bring you into her territory
(Sometimes it's a pain in the butt to prepare someone for something like that,
so having her balk at this point is no problem)
Ask "Well, then, is there anything you won't eat?"
Say something like "I'll look for a suitable place, okay? But when I go out with friends we usually just go to bars,
so I might not be able to find a nice restaurant. If that happens, will you help me find one on the day of the dinner?"
and put the ball in her court.
(But of course, you should check the area out beforehand.
If you can, actually go there once.)

557 Name: female 1 Date: 04/03/18 10:01

"About what time you do finish work?"
= "What do you want to do?" or "What shall we do?", but with the possibility of actual conversation following.
You ask a question that she can easily answer, and then take the lead.

(Supposing she says "just after 6pm, I guess")
you say "Well then, I'll meet you at (meeting place) around 7, how's that?"
= you show her that you're adapting to her convenience, plus you're not letting her escape, LOL

558 Name: female 1 Date: 04/03/18 10:01

Ummm, from my past experience....
1) It's pretty bad if it's your first time at a restaurant and you're looking around all lost.
When it happened, I wished the guy had picked a restaurant he'd have been able to relax in.
The stress of a first date combined with the stress of an unfamiliar restaurant can be explosive.

2) "What do you want to do?" is a vague question and increases the uncomfortable time when nobody is talking, so it's no good.
I want the guy to ask me questions that are a simple choice, or that I can answer and then turn into conversation.

3) No discussion of today! is your rule of conversation.
You should aim to show her that there's more to you than the original phone calls. (It's important.)
Talking endlessly about how you helped her on the train is no good.
For example: "You said you usually go to Italian restaurants, but what do you like about them?
I've never been to a real Italian restaurant before so I don't know much about them,
but I used to eat tiramisu a lot. It used to be really popular, huh." or something like that.
If you stretch yourself too far trying to talk about unfamiliar topics, you'll quickly reach your limit, so you should stick to things you know.
But if you REALLY only stick to things you know, there's the possibility that you won't be able to maintain a conversation,
so you should take the things you heard her talk about on the phone　and research them on the internet.
"On the phone last time you talked about XX - I've seen XX on the internet before,
but is it the same as YY?" is plenty of conversation.

Argh, I wanna write more but this has gotten so long, I'm gonna stop here.
I want you to do your best, seriously, 'kay?

I've been following this thread in a party mood, but it's not somewhere that an un-genuine man can be anymore...
It's becoming a thread where girls and attractive guys save people from the depths of poisonous singleness

The tale of the previous night comes real and uncut, straight from Train Man's mouth.

568 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/18 19:26

You guyz, I can't believe you stayed up so late just for me, thank you... (つД｀)
I'm off to read the log history.

So does anyone want a recap of last night's phone call?

>>534
＿|￣|

Okay, I finished reading the log history,
If I left anyone's question hanging, I'm sorry...

Judging from the way everyone was talking

"A suit and Italian food"

Is that right? I've gotta get a new suit... ＿|￣|○

581 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/18 20:01

This is my first time having dinner with a woman,
so I had no idea where I should invite her... ＿|￣|○

To tell the truth, I was depending on everyone in this thread even when I was in the middle of talking on the phone

608 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/18 20:33

It seemed like she had hurried through her bath,
so I apologized profusely for making her rush
"Really, I usually take about this long"
she said, though.

We return to our conversation.
She and the older women had been saying stuff like

"Who knows what would have happened to us if he hadn't been there
I'm so glad he helped us"

"Usually someone would just pretend that nothing was happening,
but he was very brave to take a stand"

apparently...
I don't really remember too well... ＿|￣|....○))

I said
"I still don't know if what I did then was right.
Maybe even if I hadn't said anything, the old man wouldn't have done anything,
and then none of you would have been dragged into making a police report.
I really feel bad about it."

Then she said
"What you did was right"
"I'm truly grateful"
"Not everyone could put themselves on the line for someone they've never even met"
"I've told my parents and friends all about it"

I really don't remember much else... ＿|￣|

652 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/18 20:58

Here's some advice from a single older guy.
How many years has she been a member of society?
Do you know what kind of work she does?

Based on that I'll advise you on the clothes and food.

I think somewhere in Tokyo would be ok

You can put them in your pants or coat pockets for later, if you want

↓
Go to bed early (you'll want to sleep at least 8 hours)

The day of:

Take a shower right after you wake up
Wash your body, head and face. Use Men's Biore or something for your face. Don't scrub too hard or your face will get red.
Shave now if you use a regular razor
↓
Have a light meal
↓
Facial care
Pluck your eyebrows, trim your nosehair, clean out your ears, get the sleep out of your eyes, etc.
Shave now if you use an electric razor. Don't forget the aftershave

Change clothes. Use cologne now if you re going to use it at all. Just put a little on your stomach
Don't put any on your wrists or neck.
↓
Finally, depart. (Don't forget your cell phone or wallet. Memorize her cell number, just in case)

I'm female, and I think jeans with a shirt from Comme Ca and a jacket would be nice.
Buy the jeans you're going to wear first (like the ones that were recommended before)
Wear those and ask for "A jacket and shirt that go with these,
but don't look like I'm trying too hard", and they'll recommend a variety of things for you, I bet.
You'll prolly worry about what to wear for the next time, too, so it'd be good to buy a few different shirts while you're there.
If you find a style that you like more than the others, you'll get a few of those,
but while you're there you have to buy a couple with a different feel to them!
Sorry for the long post. Good luck, Train.

114 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/20 01:12

Sorry for the wait. I went out today to prepare and do some research.
I haven't spoken with Ms. Hermes today, if you're wondering.

I'll continue the recap of the last phone call, okay?
I've forgotten most of it, tho

127 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/20 01:27

I was trying to turn the conversation towards inviting her to dinner,
and my head was filled with chanting "invite her to dinner as thanks for the cups" from this thread

I said
"The cups you sent are very high-class, aren't they.
I'm sorry for making you feel like you had to go to such troubles for me."
or something like that

"Oh, no, I can get them for a reasonable price through my office.
I'm sorry if they made you uncomfortable."
said Hermes

I figured that was my only chance to say it, so
"As thanks for the cups, would you
allow me to take you out to dinatglakrarlkgh?"

I completely choked on my own words... ＿|￣|○

134 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/20 01:35

Hermes says

"Pardon?"

That's to be expected.

I tried again
"Ummmm, how about dinner? Please allow me to treat you."
I don't remember exactly but it was something like that

"Dinner...?"
"Yes, if you wouldn't mind... ＿|￣|○"
I'm pretty sure I bowed to the phone

"Oh, you don't have to do that.
It was really nothing..."

It's no use... I'm thinking

"I see..."
I think there were a few seconds of silence

"Well then, if we go Dutch then it's okay."
"Huh?"
I made an idiotic noise without thinking... ＿|￣|○

"Dutch...?"
I understood, but not really

"It wouldn't be fair to allow you to treat, so...
What do you think?"

All of a sudden I wanted to shout
"Yeeaaahhhh━━━( ´∀`)･ω･) ﾟДﾟ)ﾟ∀ﾟ)･∀･)￣ｰ￣)´_ゝ`)-_)ﾟ∋ﾟ)´Д｀)ﾟｰﾟ)━━━!!!!"

I contained myself and typed something to this thread with one hand.
I wanted to tell you all right away.

"Really?"
"We're splitting the bill, alright?"
"Thank yokdjgnsf, thank you"
I stumbled over the words as I bowed profusely.

"When would be good for you?"
"Anytime is fine."
I immediately thought about how if this were 2ch, everyone would be saying "you need to die"

168 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/20 02:02

"Well then, I'd prefer a Saturday."
That's when would work for her.

"Yes, that's perfect."
I was planning to clear my schedule even if it wasn't.

"Well, then, where shall we eat?"
"Uhhmmm..."
My mind went blank.
I hadn't decided where, yet, had I... ＿|￣|○
I quickly scanned the thread status
and typed in an SOS without thinking

"Anywhere is fine with me."
"Ah, oh, okay, well then, uhhmmmm..."
Get it together, self!

On this thread it said "Ask if she has any likes or dislikes", so
without thinking I said
"Is there any kind of food you really like, or can't eat?"
"I can't eat really spicy food~"
"Ohh... okay...."

And time
just kept ticking by... ＿|￣|

174 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/20 02:13

That's right, I don't have to decide everything right now
I was so nervous that that simple thought didn't occur to me, I guess

"Ah, well, may I contact you again when I've found a place?"
"Of course."
"I'll search for somewhere that's not spicy."
"Alright. *laughs*"

She laughed a little here. I think.

"As for Saturday, do you mean sometime around this week or next?"
"Yes, that sounds good"
"Well, then, I'll contact you again soon"
"Alright, I'm looking forward to it"

and then it ended. All at once my body went completely limp... ＿|￣|○

I got home late
so it took me a long time just to finish reading the thread logs.

This looks like Train Man's chance to set up a second meeting.
Even if you're splitting the bill,
you should pretend to go to the bathroom, and then sneakily pay the whole thing.
So when Hermes notices and says "Today was Dutch...",
you say "Well, I am the one who invited you"
she might say "Well, then, I'll pay next time", don't you think?

That "next time" could be a chance to go straight to another restaurant,
or it could be an excuse to meet her again some other day.

213 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/20 02:33

>>198
But if she's said that they should split the bill, and that's why she agreed to go with him,
wouldn't it make her uncomfortable if he payed the entire thing?
I'm sure it partly depends on the amount, but still.

219 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/20 02:35

They may have talked on the phone a bit, but Train and Hermes are still strangers.
What's more, Train is the savior who protected her from a ruffian.
It's not just because she sent him cups, but I think it should be Dutch

For awhile after this, the hot debate of "split the bill" vs. "pay her share" continued among the residents.
To free Train Man from his horrible Akihabara-style fashion sense, the thread consults amongst themselves - plotting to improve everything from his head to his toes.

233 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/20 02:40

This is the kind of young lady who courteously sends a gift as a thank you.
If she agrees to go with you if you two go halves, and then you take that away
you'll just make her feel even more indebted.

306 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/20 03:19

Imagined Conversations During the Date.

Number One

Train Man "I thought Hermes made purses, but
they make cups, too?"
Hermes "Yes, and many other things, too. *laughs*"
T "Do they have clothes and accessories for men, too?"
H "Yes, they do. Shall I show you a catalog sometime?"
T "Yes, please. How about next week, on~

and he's got the next date set up!

Number Two

Train "Thank you for the lovely cups. It seems such a waste to use them, though; they're just too nice."
H "Eheh. I'm glad you like them."
T "Speaking of cups, do you usually drink things like tea and coffee?"
H "I love English tea, I drink it all the time."
T "Do you brew it yourself?"
H "Yes, I know a place that sells delicious tea leaves."
T "All I ever drink is instant coffee.
If you wouldn't mind, would you go with me to buy the good tea leaves?"
H "Of course. When shall we go?"
T "How about next week, on~"

and he's got the next date set up!

I think you can get somewhere by just simulating with what you have available to you now.

307 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/20 03:21

>>306
ur having fun lol

361 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/20 13:04

I think that since he invited her because he felt bad about the cups,
that he should pay for the dinner this time.
If Hermes seems like it's bothering her, let her
pay for the drinks or something.
If you tell her it's "because you haven't had much chance to take a woman to dinner"
... if it were me, I'd be turned off... I'd think "and what if you HAD had a chance?"
Since the stimulus for this one is the cups, I think it might be best if
you don't say anything about "chance".

435 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/20 18:23

Is Train home yet~~~?

443 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/20 21:12

I'm home... (　ﾟдﾟ)SPACEOUT
I'm exhausted. ＿|￣|○

This is the first time in my LIFE I've spent so much on clothes
And the first time I've used a credit card on something normal

How can a haircut be $60... ＿|￣|,,,,,,,,,,,○））
I look stylish now, but...

I picked the clothes while consulting with the store clerk
so I think they're okay.

You need insurance to get contacts, huh... ＿|￣|

Okay I'm off to read the history logs *leaves*

464 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/20 22:48

I had so much stuff to carry today I had to make a trip back
I am teh tired... but I do look different.
If you saw me from far away, I bet I don't look like an Akihabara nerd
But when I see my face in the mirror, it's still Akihabara
I want contactz

I also went and ate at the place I chose for dinner
It's one of the Japanese restaurants that was in this thread
It was (ﾟдﾟ)yummeh

I went to a hair salon for the first time in my life - one that one of the players at my office recommended
I was teh embarrassed... ＿|￣|○
But they gave me hair I couldn't have gotten at a barber
My hair's never been this short in my life...
It's all fluffy LOL

The expenses... ＿|￣|

465 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/20 22:49

>>464
Hey, have u ever had contacts b4?
Going on a date in unfamiliar week-old contacts is cutting it 2 close!

473 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/20 22:53

What kind of clothes did you buy?
|_|Pload pics.

475 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/20 22:54

>>465
Are you serious...
I guess I'll have to go without glasses, huh

>>461
I think I still look Akihabaraish


Also, the date was only 0k on the condition that we "split the bill",
so that's what I plan to do

481 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/20 23:03

>>469
>>472
With the recommendations from this thread and the store clerk's opinions,

I got a gray jacket that looks kinda like animal skin,
long-sleeved black clothes (I think I got a discount for getting the shirt and the track jacket together...)
For pants I got jeans and a pair of pants to match the jacket
darkish socks
Big, hard shoes

That's about it.

For my hair I said "please make me look cool"
and they cut it really short (´･ω･`)
I can't explain it very well, tho...

485 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/20 23:06

"Big, hard shoes"...
His explanations are a little off, huh...
D E T A I L S P L E A S E

493 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/20 23:15

>>485
They're like leather shoes
Ones that are a little funky
The clothes go with them, probably. No, definitely.

Nowadays clothes stores sell shoes, too...?

506 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/20 23:32

>>494
The jacket is Comme Ca de Mode. It was the most expensive thing I got... ＿|￣|○
The inside stuff and pants are from Uniqlo.

GYAH

545 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/21 00:21

but you know, i think it's impressive of battle train man to go out in this freezing rain to buy clothes and shoes, and go to the hair salon.

Finally Train Man schedules his date with Hermes.

604 Name: Train Man ◆nm4g8qV1Cg Date: 04/03/21 22:01

I set a trip code...

I'm gonna call her right now~

605 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/21 22:02

>>604
oooh, good luck!!

610 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/21 22:05

The aura he gives off in his posts has changed.
He doesn't seem nervous; it seems the change to his appearance chnged his mental state quite a bit, too

617 Name: Train Man ◆nm4g8qV1Cg Date: 04/03/21 22:18

0k, I finished teh call.
We have a date. (；´Д`)*pant*　(；´　　Д`)*pant*　(；´　　　Д　`)*pant pant*　：.` ；：.･∵　ﾟ　д：.`
But I'm still nervous... ＿|￣|○

622 Name: Train Man ◆nm4g8qV1Cg Date: 04/03/21 22:29

Okay, I'm gonna recap it while the memory is still fresh

"Hello, I'm sorry for calling so l..."
"Ah, hello~"

"About dinner, is Japanese food okay?"
"Yes, that's fine"

"Oh... thank goodness."
"Japanese food just seems to suit you, somehow"

"Eh, really?"
"Yes"

"I'm going to dress up a bit, so please don't laugh at me, okay... ＿|￣|○"
"Oh? You're going to dress up?"

"Yes... but please don't get your hopes up..."
"Oh? *laughs* Well, then, I'll just dress up a bit, too *laughs*"

"Ah, I'm sorry for making you feel obligated..."
"It's alright"


That's about how it went, I guess...
I messed up... ＿|￣|○

623 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/21 22:30

>>622
No, it sounded good.
Train Man is obsessed LOL

624 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/21 22:30

I'm totally addicted to Hermes...

632 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/21 22:34

His good personality must be oozing through.
Of course Hermes's impression of him was good from the get-go.
It sounds like the day of the dinner is going to be really fun!

636 Name: Train Man ◆nm4g8qV1Cg Date: 04/03/21 22:38

Eh? It was 0k?
I felt like I had totally blown it...
But I feel better now. Thank you as always, really

641 Name: Train Man ◆nm4g8qV1Cg Date: 04/03/21 22:48

Thanks you guyz, truly.
I'll do my best.

651 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/21 22:58

argh, you know, now it's just like,
T R A I N M A N . O B S E S S I O N !

652 Name: Train Man ◆nm4g8qV1Cg Date: 04/03/21 23:00

To tell the truth, I don't really think things like
wanting to make Hermes my girlfriend, yet
To say I'm thinking "If I let this chance go, I may never have another"
is the truth, but

But, I really do feel an attraction to her
I just heard her voice a little while ago, but somehow
I feel something a little different than nervousness
If I meet her, I'm definitely gonna fall for her... ＿|￣|○

Of course, she might have a boyfriend already
and if that's the case and I do fall for her, it'll be really hard on me
it's kinda hard already.

660 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/21 23:06

Train Man, you're so cool.
You're not an unpopular loser any more. You're good just as you are.
Move at your own pace, without stretching yourself too far, and have a fun time with Hermes.
If you think of your meeting her as the chance that allowed you to change yourself,
this meeting had real meaning for you from the very start, I think.
So you're never to return here.
Bonne chance.

666 Name: Train Man ◆nm4g8qV1Cg Date: 04/03/21 23:11

Thank you, everyone. Strangely, as I'm reading everyone's responses
I get the feeling that it's all going to go well. It gives me confidence.

First I have to thank her, and confirm my own feelings~~1

667 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/21 23:12

Train Man seems really serious about it, I'm totally addicted to this
Could it be you're going to the restaurant I presented?
I'm really rooting for you, so please do your best.
If my gut feeling is right, Hermes likes you a lot, too
She's not just having dinner with you out of civic duty, I think

677 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/21 23:17

When I see Train Man, I think

M A Y B E . I T . R E A L L Y . I S . W H A T ' S . I N S I D E . T H A T . C O U N T S ?

I'm not saying Train is a putz, or anything, tho

759 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/22 15:47

>>758
GYAAHH!
Cut it out, okay...

Speaking of which, someone already said it, but Train
doesn't need advice about the every day stuff any more, huh.
He can't be that far from normal, right?
Everyone was so overly-caring... Such kindness.

893 Name: 731 AKA Train Man Date: 04/03/24 22:36

Hello, long time no see.
My preparations are almost done. Also I'm working on mental preparation for the big day.

Someone offered to archive the whole thing,
but I've been archiving it myself, so it's 0k

I wonder if I'll be able to sleep the night before?

987 Name: Train Man ◆SgHguKHEFY Date: 04/03/26 14:03

Hello. I took a half day today.
I'm finally starting to get nervous... ＿|￣|○

I also got something like a party flier from one of the popular guys in my building
He said "It'll be a good conversation-starter"

125 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/27 13:18

When's Trainy-train gonna get here~~~
yay yay o(・∀・o)o(・∀・)o(o・∀・)o yay yay

I just woke up. I'm gonna get ready now

128 Name: Mr. No Name Date: 04/03/27 14:19

If you're getting ready, does that mean today is the day, then?

129 Name: Train Man ◆SgHguKHEFY Date: 04/03/27 14:21

It's today. It's soon. Just a few hourseelksgsngfs,mgsf

150 Name: Train Man ◆SgHguKHEFY Date: 04/03/27 17:53

I'm finally going to set out.

It's thanks to all of you that I've been able to come this far
I've been able to grow a little bit thanks to the advice and encouragement from so many different people
It was a short period of time, kind, but I feel like it was longer than that.
Well then, I'll give a report when I get home

*leaves*

Akihabara nerd, age = years without a girlfriend, virgi(trunkated) Train Man, finally sets out. Will Lady Luck smile upon him?
