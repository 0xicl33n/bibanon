1
00:00:04,197 --> 00:00:05,655
It's ringing.

2
00:00:18,126 --> 00:00:20,450
Hi, this is Aoyama speaking,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,854
Um, um, this is Y y yamada-

4
00:00:23,889 --> 00:00:26,327
but I'm unable to take your call at this moment.

5
00:00:26,327 --> 00:00:27,763
If you'd like to leave a message,

6
00:00:27,763 --> 00:00:31,127
please do so after the beep.

7
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,947
Um, um this is Yamada calling,

8
00:00:36,947 --> 00:00:39,804
but thank you for the c c cups-

9
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:45,382
Ow. It just had to be the edge...

10
00:00:45,948 --> 00:00:50,097
Ah-  Just now, th, that wasn't meant for you and-

11
00:00:57,037 --> 00:00:59,467
It was just her voice mail...

12
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:07,633
Maybe?

13
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:12,724
It's from the Train Man...how gross.

14
00:01:52,075 --> 00:01:54,642
Please!  Let me answer it!

15
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:09,793
Who was it?

16
00:02:09,898 --> 00:02:12,156
I don't know, probably a stranger.

17
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,932
731 - Alias Densha Otoko

18
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:23,252
I called her, but I only got her voice mail.

19
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:34,651
It still took guts; you've definitely leveled up.

20
00:02:34,825 --> 00:02:37,754
I'd like to say "look at the time!",
but you did good.

21
00:02:37,754 --> 00:02:39,410
Hope you try again tomorrow.

22
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:44,607
I'd never called a girl before,
but more than anything, I wanted to thank her.

23
00:02:44,661 --> 00:02:46,384
So I'll definitely call her again tomorrow.

24
00:02:46,384 --> 00:02:49,003
I'm all choked up watching you grow.

25
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:54,310
Who would have thought this whole incident
with Densha Otoko would get this far.

26
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:58,326
You should take it easy for tonight.  You get a B.

00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:57,615
I don't know where I'm supposed to go from here.

32
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:01,851
See here,

33
00:04:01,851 --> 00:04:04,938
if you ask the fortune teller,
he'll tell you a story about the Demon Lord.

34
00:04:04,973 --> 00:04:06,046
You're right.  Thanks.

35
00:04:06,764 --> 00:04:09,525
Hey, does Master Yamada have a girl friend?

36
00:04:09,525 --> 00:04:11,301
Uh, a girlfriend?

37
00:04:11,301 --> 00:04:13,041
There's no way he would.

38
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,014
Yeah, I know.

39
00:04:14,014 --> 00:04:17,058
If we hurt him too much, he might not help us with the game.

40
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,757
We'll be making stops at, Inagi, Tsudanuma, Funabashi, Ichikawa...

41
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:27,609
A girlfriend...I like the ring of that.

42
00:04:31,806 --> 00:04:33,910
Hello.  Mother?

43
00:04:34,994 --> 00:04:38,064
If you're calling about that, I'll talk to you about it later.

44
00:04:38,064 --> 00:04:39,910
Ok?  Later then.

45
00:04:40,251 --> 00:04:41,299
Another arranged marriage?

but thank you for the c c cups-

50
00:04:58,309 --> 00:05:00,379
Yamada, you're free tonight aren't you?

51
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:01,624
Yes.

52
00:05:01,624 --> 00:05:04,399
Then we're going to have dinner with one of our clients.

53
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:05,685
Dinner?

54
00:05:05,685 --> 00:05:08,439
Yeah, dinner.

55
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:10,831
It's at 7:00 with the president of Hikari Sangyou.

56
00:05:10,831 --> 00:05:13,605
But isn't that Oikawa-san's account?

57
00:05:17,905 --> 00:05:20,400
Oh, sorry about this.  I have things I have to do.

58
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,361
You don't have to worry about anything, Oikawa.

59
00:05:22,361 --> 00:05:24,997
It doesn't matter whose account it is, you little lackey.

60
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:27,022
I'll leave it to you then.

61
00:05:27,022 --> 00:05:27,892
I'm off to see some companies.

62
00:05:27,892 --> 00:05:29,608
Take care, Oikawa.

63
00:05:29,608 --> 00:05:30,971
See you at 7:00...oops.

64
00:05:30,971 --> 00:05:32,974
See you at 7:00, you little runt.

65
00:05:32,974 --> 00:05:34,640
Ok.

Call From
Jinkama-san

69
00:06:10,696 --> 00:06:13,033
Yes, this is Yamada speaking, but is there anything wrong?

70
00:06:13,033 --> 00:06:15,007
Why else do you think I'd be calling?

71
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:16,809
Of course there's a problem.

72
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:19,897
How am I supposed to talk to you
about the trouble I'm having with my boss?

73
00:06:19,897 --> 00:06:21,582
You're already having problems with your boss?

74
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:23,425
It's still the first day!

75
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,502
Well they say you should make a strong first impression.

76
00:06:25,809 --> 00:06:27,763
I don't think that's what they mean.

77
00:06:31,113 --> 00:06:31,831
Aoyama-san.

78
00:06:32,464 --> 00:06:34,599
Isn't that oil paper a little big?  It's fine.

79
00:06:37,454 --> 00:06:38,640
Are you listening?

80
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,549
Yes.

81
00:06:39,549 --> 00:06:40,710
I was thinking...

82
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:44,138
Maybe it'd be easier if I just slept with the manager.

83
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:45,372
Um..Jinkama-san,

84
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:46,480
I've got a call on the other line.

85
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,198
Do you think I'm letting you off that easy?

86
00:06:48,198 --> 00:06:49,777
No, I've really got another call!

87
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:51,521
Then why don't you just ignore it?

88
00:06:51,521 --> 00:06:53,639
I really can't.

89
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:56,382
You know, from what I hear,

90
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:59,563
the manager seems to like it really wild!

91
00:06:59,563 --> 00:07:02,013
Look, I really help you with things lik-

92
00:07:06,454 --> 00:07:08,912
What is it, a guy?

93
00:07:08,912 --> 00:07:11,282
Sort of.

94
00:07:11,282 --> 00:07:13,476
Something going on.

95
00:07:14,812 --> 00:07:18,850
I really don't know anything about the merry-go-round move.

96
00:07:19,243 --> 00:07:22,946
Are you sure we're not liable if
anything happens while you're doing it?

97
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:29,569
Jinkama-san?

98
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:32,658
She just does what she wants...

99
00:07:32,658 --> 00:07:36,400
Hey, are you done yet?  Hurry up!

100
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,657
So it's you...

101
00:07:42,581 --> 00:07:47,004
I'm so sorry.  Sorry everyone.

102
00:07:55,364 --> 00:07:57,214
Man, that was long...

103
00:08:00,853 --> 00:08:02,340
Aoyama-san

104
00:08:13,412 --> 00:08:15,360
Please recharge your batteries.

105
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:26,113
Why, why, why?

106
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:36,854
Oh yeah...

107
00:08:39,976 --> 00:08:42,922
How do I call her now?

I'm sorry.

125
00:11:06,682 --> 00:11:08,218
Of course it wouldn't fit.

126

Nothing.

131
00:11:32,907 --> 00:11:35,020
I see...

00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,169

I want to buy a battery charger.

I couldn't reach your cell.

141
00:12:46,524 --> 00:12:48,648
So this was where you were dawdling.

142
00:12:49,295 --> 00:12:50,076
I wasn't.

143
00:12:50,076 --> 00:12:51,170
What are you crying for?

144
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,971
We're off to dinner.

145
00:12:58,249 --> 00:12:59,494
Until a car comes.

146
00:12:59,702 --> 00:13:02,330
Mr. President, that joke was pure genious.

147
00:13:02,331 --> 00:13:03,331
Really?

148
00:13:03,413 --> 00:13:05,504
Do you have any other ones?

149
00:13:05,504 --> 00:13:08,433
What did the slayer say to the vampire?
You have a stake at stake.

150
00:13:08,468 --> 00:13:11,763
Ah, ha hA!  Oh help me, that was so funny!

151
00:13:12,111 --> 00:13:14,871
So how old is your grandson now?

152
00:13:14,906 --> 00:13:16,479
Oh, he turned 5 just last month.

153
00:13:17,549 --> 00:13:21,785
He really likes this anime called Mina.

154
00:13:21,785 --> 00:13:23,885
What?  Have you heard of it?

155
00:13:23,885 --> 00:13:25,173
Yes, a little.

156
00:13:25,173 --> 00:13:27,033
That's great then.

157
00:13:27,033 --> 00:13:28,823
My daughter tried to explanation it to me

158
00:13:28,823 --> 00:13:30,955
but I just can't seem to get through to him.

159
00:13:30,955 --> 00:13:32,419
I haven't received any more voice mails either.

160
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:34,011
The person who helped you on the train?

161
00:13:36,105 --> 00:13:37,175
Was he good looking?

162
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:42,332
I couldn't see him well because I wasn't
wearing my contacts, but

163
00:13:42,332 --> 00:13:44,057
he looked...

164
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:45,607
designed for hard core anime fans.

165
00:13:45,607 --> 00:13:47,453
It's done by Gonzo, who's famous for his high quality CG work.

166
00:13:47,453 --> 00:13:50,739
He did it in an 80's style,
which is actually refreshing now.

167
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:52,274
The story's also a classic.

168
00:13:52,274 --> 00:13:53,819
Trapped in the nether world, Mina's saved

169
00:13:53,819 --> 00:13:55,645
only because he's interested in you.

170
00:13:55,645 --> 00:13:56,971
It's gotta be it.

171
00:13:56,971 --> 00:13:59,049
No way.  Anyway you look at it, he was your brave hero.

172
00:13:59,049 --> 00:14:01,708
Like The Last Samurai, like Tom Cruise.

173
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,569
Well he was Japanese.

174
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:05,102
A Ken Watanabe huh?

175
00:14:05,102 --> 00:14:07,788
This conversation's getting weird,
so leave your delusions to yourself.

176
00:14:07,788 --> 00:14:09,497
What did you say to me?

177
00:14:09,497 --> 00:14:12,354
I thought he really seemed like an earnest person.

178
00:14:12,354 --> 00:14:15,479
exactly, there's no faulting his regard for her.

179
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:19,444
Her presence alone, as they travel through the nether world,
is enough to restore his soul.

180
00:14:19,444 --> 00:14:20,725
If it wasn't for that

181
00:14:20,725 --> 00:14:22,980
I don't think he would have called just to thank me.

182
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,559
And that's all a ploy just to lure you.

183
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:27,199
You really shouldn't take him seriously.

184
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,146
Isn't it you with the over-active imagination?

185
00:14:29,146 --> 00:14:31,913
Get a boyfriend, and then I'll listen to you.

186
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:34,984
You've got a lot of nerve.  Let's take this outside.

187
00:14:34,984 --> 00:14:38,695
But Mina decides to stay in the nether world
to vanquish the forces of evil!

188
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,215
She's-

189
00:14:53,787 --> 00:14:56,410
I just got back home from work.

190
00:14:56,665 --> 00:14:59,050
Finally, after all this time.

191
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:02,570
After all the times she called me.

192
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,756
He's back!!

193
00:15:04,756 --> 00:15:07,526
You don't know how long I've been waiting for this.

194
00:15:07,526 --> 00:15:09,501
First relax and have a cup of tea.

195
00:15:09,501 --> 00:15:11,404
Tea can come later!

196
00:15:11,404 --> 00:15:12,852
Call her up!

197
00:15:14,883 --> 00:15:16,327
I'm going to call her now.

198
00:15:16,327 --> 00:15:18,404
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

199
00:15:18,404 --> 00:15:19,679
You did it yesterday, you can do it today.

200
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:21,607
Don't cry if it goes badly.

201
00:15:21,607 --> 00:15:23,977
Give us a full report when you're done.

202
00:15:59,898 --> 00:16:01,668
Aoyama-san

203
00:16:10,988 --> 00:16:12,216
Hello?

204
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:16,436
I guess he'll be calling her right now.

205
00:16:17,824 --> 00:16:20,354
We have nothing to do but wait.

206
00:16:23,545 --> 00:16:27,969
I don't think I've felt this way
since my days in the debate club.

207
00:16:28,448 --> 00:16:33,122
This makes me think of watching my
son at school during open house.

208
00:16:33,122 --> 00:16:35,644
I wonder what they're talking about now.

209
00:16:35,644 --> 00:16:38,652
Densha's probably having a hard time.

210
00:16:38,652 --> 00:16:39,853
I can see that happening.

211
00:16:39,853 --> 00:16:44,269
Doesn't anyone else have problems?
There's nothing to do here.

212
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:57,527
After I got layed off at work, I filed for divorce,
and left our house.

213
00:16:58,256 --> 00:17:03,093
I thought my wife would be angry with me,
but she's waiting for me to come back.

214
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:07,934
I just don't know what I should tell her.

215
00:17:09,568 --> 00:17:11,854
Someone really responded.

216
00:17:11,854 --> 00:17:14,691
I have no sympathy for guys this fortunate.

217
00:17:14,691 --> 00:17:18,734
Mr. Layed Off, think about how your wife feels first.

218
00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:21,565
I'm actually replying seriously.

219
00:17:21,565 --> 00:17:23,443
How do you feel about your wife?

220
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:25,326
That's the important thing.

221
00:17:25,326 --> 00:17:27,538
Haven't you learned anything from Densha?

222
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:44,722
I just got off the phone.

223
00:17:44,722 --> 00:17:47,098
My hands are still shaking.

224
00:17:47,098 --> 00:17:49,241
Yes!

225
00:17:49,241 --> 00:17:50,794
You did good, you're a real man.

226
00:17:50,794 --> 00:17:52,402
How'd it go?

227
00:17:52,402 --> 00:17:54,747
She actually had to go take a bath.

228
00:17:54,747 --> 00:17:58,596
Hermes-san says she'll call back later.

229
00:17:58,596 --> 00:18:01,138
It was no good, I was too nervous...

230
00:18:01,138 --> 00:18:02,747
Come on, tell us more.

231
00:18:02,747 --> 00:18:04,746
You got KOed in the first round huh?

232
00:18:04,747 --> 00:18:06,709
Hermes-san's in a bath?

233
00:18:08,403 --> 00:18:11,026
Good job there, give us the details.

234
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,827
The details, give us the full scoop.

235
00:18:19,292 --> 00:18:22,898
Ok, I'll explain what happened.

236
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:25,449
Hello?

237
00:18:25,778 --> 00:18:26,778
5 min. ago

238
00:18:25,777 --> 00:18:29,369
I'm calling on behalf of - oops.  Uh, uh.

239
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:30,476
This is Yamada calling.

240
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:33,104
Yamada-san?

241
00:18:33,104 --> 00:18:35,339
I'm so glad.

242
00:18:35,339 --> 00:18:36,753
We finally get to talk.

243
00:18:37,773 --> 00:18:39,023
I'm sorry.

244
00:18:40,201 --> 00:18:41,578
It's ok.

245
00:18:42,825 --> 00:18:45,648
The cups.  Th, th, th, th, th.

246
00:18:47,515 --> 00:18:49,371
Thank you so much for them.

247
00:18:49,371 --> 00:18:51,362
I don't deserve anything so nice.

248
00:18:51,362 --> 00:18:52,339
It's nothing.

249
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,599
I couldn't finish leaving you a message yesterday, and

250
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:56,294
I'm so sorry.

251
00:18:56,294 --> 00:18:58,010
It's ok.

252
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:01,673
And I'm so sorry I couldn't return your calls immediately.

253
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:03,633
It's ok.

254
00:19:03,633 --> 00:19:07,779
And it's taken me so long to finally call you.

255
00:19:10,322 --> 00:19:11,837
Is anything wrong?

256
00:19:11,837 --> 00:19:13,614
No, I'm sorry.

257
00:19:13,614 --> 00:19:18,886
You keep apologizing, and all I can say is that it's ok.

258
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,566
I'm sorry-

259
00:19:21,876 --> 00:19:24,069
You're an interesting person.

260
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:27,874
I almost forgot.

261
00:19:27,874 --> 00:19:30,324
I didn't properly thank you that time.

262
00:19:30,324 --> 00:19:31,609
Not at all.

263
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:33,812
It seems the police kept you pretty late.

264
00:19:33,812 --> 00:19:36,675
Actually, we got to leave pretty soon after you did.

265
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:40,156
We were talking about you on the way to the station.

266
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,106
About me?

267
00:19:43,106 --> 00:19:46,939
How you put yourself at risk for total strangers.

268
00:19:47,826 --> 00:19:50,626
You were really brave for someone young.

269
00:19:57,073 --> 00:19:58,483
Yamada-san?

270
00:19:59,482 --> 00:20:01,362
I'm sorry.

271
00:20:02,646 --> 00:20:05,532
It's kind of embarrassing.

272
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:08,592
Your bath's done.

273
00:20:08,592 --> 00:20:09,970
I'll go in later.

274
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,218
It'll cool down.

275
00:20:11,218 --> 00:20:12,963
It's going to have to wait.

276
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:14,150
Uhh.

277
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,545
I'm sorry.

278
00:20:15,545 --> 00:20:19,040
My Mom's pestering me to take a bath.

279
00:20:20,589 --> 00:20:23,815
I really don't mind.

280
00:20:23,815 --> 00:20:27,687
No it's ok.  I'll go in later.

281
00:20:27,687 --> 00:20:30,774
No really, I couldn't keep you.

282
00:20:31,823 --> 00:20:33,223
Really?

283
00:20:34,744 --> 00:20:38,702
Then can I call you back after I get out?

284
00:20:39,246 --> 00:20:42,787
If it's not bother for you.

285
00:20:42,787 --> 00:20:46,967
N, no.  It's no problem at all.

286
00:20:46,967 --> 00:20:48,833
Then I'll talk to you later.

287
00:20:49,574 --> 00:20:52,472
Ok, I'll be waiting then.

288
00:20:59,312 --> 00:21:05,546
So now what should I do from here?

289
00:21:06,987 --> 00:21:08,895
Let her know you want to meet her somehow.

290
00:21:08,969 --> 00:21:10,830
Thank her by taking her out to dinner.

291
00:21:10,865 --> 00:21:11,811
I totally agree.

292
00:21:12,194 --> 00:21:15,278
Isn't a thank you dinner strange for a thank you gift?

293
00:21:15,511 --> 00:21:17,082
I need a serious option here.

294
00:21:17,082 --> 00:21:18,290
I'd say it's normal.

295
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:21,953
Can't you tell her you'd like to thank her in person?

296
00:21:21,988 --> 00:21:23,052
I'm a girl,

297
00:21:23,052 --> 00:21:24,753
but instead of saying you want to meet her,

298
00:21:24,753 --> 00:21:27,232
you should just casually invite her to dinner.

299
00:21:27,232 --> 00:21:29,658
Is Hermes still taking a bath?

300
00:21:29,658 --> 00:21:32,731
I'm getting excited just thinking about it.

301
00:21:33,414 --> 00:21:34,820
It's a guy isn't it?

302
00:21:35,108 --> 00:21:36,510
So you were listening.

303
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,349
I just overhead you.

304
00:21:39,096 --> 00:21:40,847
Is that so.

305
00:21:44,681 --> 00:21:48,545
Take her to dinner to thank her.
Take her to dinner to thank her.
Take her to dinner to thank her.
Take her to dinner to thank her.
Take her to dinner to thank her.

306
00:21:49,435 --> 00:21:54,322
"I feel bad recieving something so nice,
but is there anyway I can make it up to you?"

307
00:21:54,436 --> 00:21:56,987
"I know, how about dinner sometime?"  What do you think?

308
00:21:56,987 --> 00:21:59,185
This is it.

309
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:05,205
"I feel bad recieving something so nice,
but is there anyway I can make it up to you?"

310
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,709
"I know, how about dinner sometime?"  What do you think?

311
00:22:10,154 --> 00:22:12,293
Hey, why don't you come here for a minute.

312
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:14,525
What is it?  Is there someone you want me to meet?

313
00:22:15,525 --> 00:22:17,226
This time, he's perfect.

314
00:22:17,226 --> 00:22:18,411
Then I'll look at it later.

315
00:22:18,411 --> 00:22:19,868
Why not now?

316
00:22:19,868 --> 00:22:22,105
Ok, I'll give it a good look.

317
00:22:22,105 --> 00:22:22,969
I have to make a call now.

318
00:22:22,969 --> 00:22:24,085
Again?

319
00:22:24,085 --> 00:22:25,771
We were in the middle of talking.

320
00:22:25,771 --> 00:22:27,549
I'm not saying you should stop dating.

321
00:22:27,549 --> 00:22:29,278
This isn't like that.

322
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,717
Is that so?

323
00:22:33,126 --> 00:22:38,146
I know, how about dinner sometime?  What do you think?

324
00:22:38,146 --> 00:22:40,308
I feel bad recieving something-

325
00:22:43,387 --> 00:22:45,649
She called.

326
00:22:51,672 --> 00:22:52,604
Yes?

327
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:53,505
I'm sorry,

328
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:54,738
but did you wait long?

329
00:22:54,738 --> 00:22:56,176
No.  Not at all.

330
00:22:56,176 --> 00:22:58,250
You can do it Densha Otoko.

331
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,529
Please, let everything go well.

332
00:23:00,529 --> 00:23:04,340
Densha, take it easy.

333
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,936
So this is it then.

334
00:23:06,077 --> 00:23:07,468
I'm praying for you.

335
00:23:07,468 --> 00:23:10,022
This is the first time I've prayed for someone.

336
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:13,008
How are you helping, getting all worked up yourselves?

337
00:23:13,008 --> 00:23:17,606
Those c c cups you sent me.
They were really e e expensive, weren't they?

338
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:21,326
You really shouldn't have.

339
00:23:21,326 --> 00:23:22,318
It's ok.

340
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:24,453
I can get them for cheap from where I work.

341
00:23:24,453 --> 00:23:29,131
I'm sorry myself.
I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable.

342
00:23:29,927 --> 00:23:32,295
Uh, uh, uh, ummm.

343
00:23:34,739 --> 00:23:39,409
Please.  Let everything go welllll!!

344
00:23:40,469 --> 00:23:42,351
The cups-

345
00:23:44,766 --> 00:23:47,315
Um.  I wanted to thank you, b but

346
00:23:47,315 --> 00:23:51,139
if it's ok, would you got to dinner wish mye?  Uh.

347
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:52,180
Um?

348
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,824
H, h, h, h, h, h, ho

349
00:23:54,815 --> 00:23:57,709
H h how would you like to go to dinner?

350
00:23:57,709 --> 00:24:00,172
I If it's ok, I'd like to t t treat you to something.

351
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:02,744
You don't have to worry about it so much.

352
00:24:02,744 --> 00:24:05,354
It really wasn't that expensive.

353
00:24:05,354 --> 00:24:07,616
Keep at it, keep at it, keep at it.

354
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:11,395
That's good.

355
00:24:30,181 --> 00:24:32,743
It's really not right for you to treat me.

356
00:24:36,571 --> 00:24:38,958
How about if we split the bill?

357
00:24:39,743 --> 00:24:42,305
I think it'd be ok if we split it.

358
00:24:43,153 --> 00:24:44,672
Really?

359
00:24:44,672 --> 00:24:46,310
You'd really don't mind?

360
00:24:47,355 --> 00:24:47,950
No.

361
00:24:50,229 --> 00:24:53,718
So when should it be?

362
00:24:53,718 --> 00:24:55,418
When we meet.

363
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:02,621
Let's see, what's a good day for you?

364
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:06,605
I'm... let me see.

365
00:25:08,826 --> 00:25:11,852
How about next Sunday?

366
00:25:11,852 --> 00:25:13,238
I'm free.

367
00:25:13,238 --> 00:25:15,212
Then next Sunday it is.

368
00:25:16,225 --> 00:25:19,020
Where should we eat?

369
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:32,611
Food.  Where's good?

370
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:38,712
Food?

371
00:25:38,712 --> 00:25:40,098
Yes!!

372
00:25:40,683 --> 00:25:43,769
Chinese, Japanese, Italian...  What should it be?

373
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,430
That noodle place we went to in Tokyo, what was it called?

374
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:51,159
Idiot!  You don't go for noodles on a first date!

375
00:25:51,351 --> 00:25:52,988
Is it going well? Is that what it is?

376
00:25:52,988 --> 00:25:54,269
Ask her if she can't eat anything first!

377
00:25:55,447 --> 00:25:56,262
Ok.

378
00:25:56,538 --> 00:25:58,694
These short sentences are great.

379
00:25:58,694 --> 00:26:00,825
My heart's pounding here.

380
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:03,547
Is there anything you really like?  Anything you can't eat?

381
00:26:03,547 --> 00:26:06,165
I can't eat anything too hot.

382
00:26:07,217 --> 00:26:08,843
You can almost see what's happening on the other end.

383
00:26:08,843 --> 00:26:10,369
Decide where to meet.

384
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:12,064
Where should we meet?

385
00:26:12,064 --> 00:26:14,217
Do you know a good place to eat?

386
00:26:14,217 --> 00:26:17,791
We'll find a good place, so keep her talking.

387
00:26:17,791 --> 00:26:21,016
Umm, uhh.

388
00:26:21,016 --> 00:26:22,742
How about one of those popular restaurant/bars?

389
00:26:22,742 --> 00:26:24,634
Just don't choose a place too quiet.

390
00:26:24,634 --> 00:26:28,531
Go Italian!

391
00:26:28,531 --> 00:26:32,256
How about somewhere in the Aoyama neighborhood?

392
00:26:32,256 --> 00:26:33,752
A , a, Aoyama.

393
00:26:35,003 --> 00:26:36,291
Ok.

394
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:37,904
You can finalize where to eat when you meet her.

395
00:26:37,904 --> 00:26:40,874
Tell her you'll contact her when you decide on a good place.

396
00:26:42,569 --> 00:26:46,466
Can I call you back when I find a good place?

397
00:26:46,466 --> 00:26:47,965
Sure, that sounds fine.

398
00:26:47,965 --> 00:26:51,267
Find something good to end the conversation!

399
00:26:51,267 --> 00:26:54,794
Ok, then I'll find somewhere good that isn't too hot.

400
00:26:54,794 --> 00:26:56,280
Ok.

401
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,263
Did it go ok?

402
00:26:57,263 --> 00:26:58,584
You were rejected weren't you?

403
00:26:58,584 --> 00:27:00,301
I wonder if they're still talking?

404
00:27:00,301 --> 00:27:03,526
Hurry up and let us know how it went!

405
00:27:18,191 --> 00:27:20,465
I just got off the phone.

406
00:27:20,465 --> 00:27:23,613
Succeeded in asking her to dinner.

407
00:27:23,613 --> 00:27:26,825
The big day is next Sunday.

408
00:27:26,825 --> 00:27:30,928
Thanks so much.  All of you.

409
00:27:33,254 --> 00:27:35,133
Yes!!

410
00:28:03,694 --> 00:28:05,657
Densha Otoko
Congratulations

411
00:28:09,564 --> 00:28:10,525
Awesome Densha Otoko.

412
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:20,726
Densha, you're flying now.
Fantastic, have a fun dinner!!

413
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:32,016
What?  You're meeting that guy on the train?

414
00:28:32,016 --> 00:28:34,455
The Last Samurai huh?  That's great.

415
00:28:34,567 --> 00:28:36,290
He's probably no good.

416
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,615
And I'm totally ignored.

417
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:40,482
Anyway, why is it that you get so worked up
when it's about Saori?

418
00:28:40,482 --> 00:28:42,328
Thats..

419
00:28:42,328 --> 00:28:46,436
It's just dinner.  You two don't have to worry.

420
00:28:46,471 --> 00:28:47,520
Ok then.

421
00:28:50,318 --> 00:28:52,137
Stylish Restaurants

422
00:28:53,082 --> 00:28:55,697
What are you doing reading something like that?

423
00:28:55,697 --> 00:28:57,048
Jinkama-san.

424
00:28:58,646 --> 00:29:00,980
If you were coming to our company,

425
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:04,569
you should have come to say hi.  It's customary.

426
00:29:04,569 --> 00:29:07,549
So how did it go with your boss?

427
00:29:07,549 --> 00:29:09,442
Well I already shacked up with him.

428
00:29:09,442 --> 00:29:10,979
You shacked-

429
00:29:10,979 --> 00:29:12,529
Really?

430
00:29:12,529 --> 00:29:14,903
If you were to go to dinner,

431
00:29:14,903 --> 00:29:17,126
hypothetically speaking,

432
00:29:17,126 --> 00:29:19,769
where would you want to go?

433
00:29:19,769 --> 00:29:21,409
With who?

434
00:29:21,409 --> 00:29:22,755
With me.

435
00:29:22,755 --> 00:29:24,881
It wouldn't happen.

436
00:29:24,881 --> 00:29:27,064
I'm asking saying, if.

437
00:29:27,064 --> 00:29:28,917
And I'm saying it could never happen.

438
00:29:28,917 --> 00:29:32,843
There's no way a regular girl would
go to dinner with an Otaku like you.

439
00:29:34,251 --> 00:29:36,261
Don't you know?

440
00:29:36,261 --> 00:29:38,140
You have Otaku written all over you.

441
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,081
Otaku?

442
00:29:39,081 --> 00:29:41,940
From top to bottom, you're pure Otaku.

443
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,308
You're such an Otaku, you can smell it.

444
00:29:43,308 --> 00:29:44,579
You can smell it?

445
00:29:44,579 --> 00:29:48,238
Yeah.  Fix yourself up, and like, try again.

446
00:29:57,169 --> 00:29:59,396
Can you smell it?

447
00:30:04,255 --> 00:30:06,200
I just realized something terrible.

448
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,796
I went ahead and asked Hermes to dinner,

449
00:30:08,796 --> 00:30:12,237
but if she met an Otaku like me,
I'd come to a really messy end.

450
00:30:12,237 --> 00:30:13,603
What should I do?

451
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:15,757
It's no use saying that now.

452
00:30:15,757 --> 00:30:17,127
Forget dating if that's what you think.

453
00:30:17,127 --> 00:30:18,336
I'm hopeless...

454
00:30:18,336 --> 00:30:19,455
It's a pretty big problem,

455
00:30:19,455 --> 00:30:22,549
but let's solve it step by step.

456
00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:25,193
Don't worry; your main problem is your looks.

457
00:30:25,194 --> 00:30:28,260
If you change how you look,
you should be able to hide your Otaku.

458
00:30:28,184 --> 00:30:30,569
When you change how you look,
you change how you feel.

459
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:38,245
This thread has suddenly become a thread where we help the Train Man.

460
00:30:38,245 --> 00:30:41,705
I see a complete lecture coming,
from clothes to what to say during a date.

461
00:30:41,705 --> 00:30:44,715
Let's start with coordinating the clothes.

462
00:30:44,715 --> 00:30:47,939
The Densha Otoko Renewal Project

463
00:30:51,588 --> 00:30:54,905
If it's clothes, leave it to me!!
This is getting exciting!
Me first, me first!
Good luck Densha Otoko!

464
00:30:55,842 --> 00:30:58,821
Would you guys go to Shibuya with me?

465
00:30:58,821 --> 00:31:00,340
Shibuya?

466
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,685
Please?

467
00:31:01,685 --> 00:31:02,770
You're crazy!

468
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:04,952
That isn't a place we can ever venture.

469
00:31:04,952 --> 00:31:07,492
But I really need some help here.

470
00:31:07,492 --> 00:31:10,611
We're not listening, we not listening!

471
00:31:13,325 --> 00:31:15,260
Shibuya

472
00:31:16,701 --> 00:31:21,987
You don't go around wearing a waist pouch,
with your sleeves rolled up do you?
Nah, guess not.

473
00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:29,470
Our budget is 50,000 yen.

474
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,390
Is everyone ready?

475
00:31:41,215 --> 00:31:43,320
First change your hairstyle.

476
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,720
Don't even think about going to some 1000 yen shop.

477
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,545
Not a barber, but a proper hair stylist.

478
00:31:47,545 --> 00:31:50,068
If you want to go for impact, go with a hawk or dreads.

479
00:31:50,068 --> 00:31:52,135
Short hair always gives you a good impression.

480
00:31:52,135 --> 00:31:54,461
Forget blond hair, but some color is good.

481
00:31:54,461 --> 00:31:56,616
I think you should leave it up to the stylists.

482
00:31:56,616 --> 00:31:58,650
Oh yeah.

483
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,578
Can I leave it to you?

484
00:31:59,578 --> 00:32:01,111
Certainly!

485
00:32:01,146 --> 00:32:04,731
Don't get too excited with those soft female hands on you.

486
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,242
Hatoh Contacts

487
00:32:16,862 --> 00:32:18,432
Next are the clothes.

488
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:21,139
It'll probably take him a while before he
can work up the courage to enter a store.

489
00:32:21,174 --> 00:32:23,919
Think about Hermes.  Then you can do anything.

490
00:32:35,389 --> 00:32:36,751
Welcome to our store.

491
00:32:36,751 --> 00:32:39,530
Don't panic when you're asked what you're interested in.

492
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:44,161
Just think about Hermes.  You can really do anything.

493
00:32:48,395 --> 00:32:49,746
If you're a man, you gotta style like a punk rocker.

494
00:32:49,746 --> 00:32:52,218
Army wear says you can protect a girl!

495
00:32:52,218 --> 00:32:55,485
The biggest point is the shoes;
go with a U or square tip.

496
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:57,541
For an artistic look, you want the clothes to fit tight.

497
00:32:57,541 --> 00:32:58,671
Can't you go with what you have?

498
00:32:58,671 --> 00:33:00,720
If your whole outfit's not brand name, it'll look lame.

499
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,782
We'll be over budget then.

500
00:33:01,782 --> 00:33:03,839
As long as you coordinate it properly, it'll be fine.

501
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:07,468
Ask one of the store people what would look best on you.

502
00:33:07,468 --> 00:33:09,114
That makes sense.

503
00:33:09,648 --> 00:33:11,709
I guess Italian might be best for dinner.

504
00:33:11,709 --> 00:33:16,143
Sushi, eating at a diner, fastfood,
cooking food over a hot plate... Noodles are out though.

505
00:33:16,317 --> 00:33:18,312
A Bar/Restaurant has good atmosphere.

506
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:21,662
Another vote for a nice bar/restaurant
where you can get comfortable.

507
00:33:21,695 --> 00:33:22,901
Your order's ready.

508
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:29,552
If you've never been to one before, you should go in advance,
so you won't dither when you order.

509
00:33:29,838 --> 00:33:31,329
Makes sense.

510
00:33:31,329 --> 00:33:34,532
I never thought I'd pay so much attention to what a woman says.

511
00:33:34,532 --> 00:33:38,975
I hope we were able to help Densha Otoko at least a little.

512
00:33:40,678 --> 00:33:42,022
H, hot.

513
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,749
No good for Aoyama-san.

514
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,577
I should check where the washrooms and cashier are located.

515
00:34:01,259 --> 00:34:02,483
I'm home.

516
00:34:02,483 --> 00:34:03,869
You're back.

517
00:34:03,869 --> 00:34:06,779
Your Mom's gone on out to patroll.

518
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,713
Gross, what are you-

519
00:34:13,031 --> 00:34:15,559
Your hair...and your glasses.

520
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:20,167
Uh, I thought I'd make it lighter.  Is it wierd?

521
00:34:20,645 --> 00:34:22,980
Are you wearing cologne?

522
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,700
You can tell?

523
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,853
So it actually makes a difference.

524
00:34:27,853 --> 00:34:29,394
Hey Tsuyoshi.

525
00:34:29,394 --> 00:34:31,515
What are you trying to do?

526
00:34:32,089 --> 00:34:33,651
Everything went according to plan.

527
00:34:33,651 --> 00:34:36,021
I'm giving her a call right now.

528
00:34:38,896 --> 00:34:40,074
Give it your best.

529
00:34:40,074 --> 00:34:41,140
You can feel this aura from about his posts.

530
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,379
He doesn't sound flustered anymore, does he?

531
00:34:51,063 --> 00:34:53,128
Ok.

532
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:05,214
Hello?

533
00:35:06,077 --> 00:35:10,270
Sorry for c, calling so late at nyight.

534
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:12,139
Good evening.

535
00:35:12,139 --> 00:35:15,302
How does Japanese sound, for dinner tomorrow?

536
00:35:15,302 --> 00:35:17,086
That'll be fine.

537
00:35:18,013 --> 00:35:19,799
That's good.

538
00:35:19,799 --> 00:35:22,752
Japanese...that fits your image.

539
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:26,816
Really...

540
00:35:26,816 --> 00:35:28,823
Also, about tomorrow.

541
00:35:28,823 --> 00:35:33,842
I might go a little dressed up,
but please don't laught when you see me.

542
00:35:33,681 --> 00:35:35,398
Dressed up?

543
00:35:35,398 --> 00:35:38,323
Not that you shouldn't expect too much...

544
00:35:38,587 --> 00:35:40,953
Really?

545
00:35:40,953 --> 00:35:45,448
Then I'll also dress up for dinner.

546
00:35:45,448 --> 00:35:46,733
I'm sorry.

547
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:48,618
For what?

548
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:54,711
I feel like I'm forcing you to dress up on my account.

549
00:35:57,293 --> 00:35:58,571
Uhh...umm.

550
00:35:58,571 --> 00:36:00,925
You know, you're right.

551
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:03,817
You shouldn't try to just please someone else.

552
00:36:03,817 --> 00:36:06,934
It's not good for the either of you.

553
00:36:09,526 --> 00:36:12,037
It was about something else I was thinking about.

554
00:36:12,037 --> 00:36:14,192
I'll see you tomorrow then.

555
00:36:14,192 --> 00:36:17,419
Ok, tomorrow then.

556
00:36:33,726 --> 00:36:35,478
What do you think of this?

557
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:37,855
I was thinking...

558
00:36:37,855 --> 00:36:40,833
do you think you can call off meeting this person?

559
00:36:40,833 --> 00:36:41,927
Why?

560
00:36:42,807 --> 00:36:44,437
If I'm not interested in him,

561
00:36:44,437 --> 00:36:46,775
I think it would be impolite.

562
00:36:48,157 --> 00:36:50,249
You're still not ready?

563
00:36:51,978 --> 00:36:54,354
Saori,

564
00:36:54,354 --> 00:36:56,942
I'm sorry.

565
00:36:56,942 --> 00:37:00,531
I went out and bought all these Kimonos you know.

566
00:37:02,646 --> 00:37:04,890
I'm not giving up you know?

567
00:37:07,853 --> 00:37:11,188
It went kind of like that.  I think I messed up.

568
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:12,943
No, no.  I think it was fine.

569
00:37:12,943 --> 00:37:15,244
You're hot stuff, Densha Otoko.

570
00:37:15,244 --> 00:37:17,555
I'm into Hermes too now.

571
00:37:17,555 --> 00:37:21,307
I think all your best qualities showed through.

572
00:37:21,307 --> 00:37:24,211
It's going to be pretty exiting come Sunday.

573
00:37:32,196 --> 00:37:40,642
You know, I haven't actually thought about
going out with Hermes-san, or anything yet.

574
00:37:41,611 --> 00:37:48,124
It's true that I'll never get a chance like this though.

575
00:37:49,561 --> 00:37:54,100
I am definitely feeling attracted to her.

576
00:37:54,433 --> 00:38:00,907
When I talked to her just now,
I felt something more than just nervousness.

577
00:38:01,691 --> 00:38:04,720
If I meet her again, I'll probably end up falling for her.

578
00:38:05,996 --> 00:38:09,965
Of course she probably has a boyfriend,

579
00:38:09,965 --> 00:38:15,638
and then if I do fall for her, I'm really going to suffer.

580
00:38:15,638 --> 00:38:18,228
It hurts right now.

581
00:38:22,355 --> 00:38:28,671
But that a total loser like me could ever feel this way,
is really an amazing thing.

582
00:38:29,906 --> 00:38:33,818
And it's all because I had all of you around.

583
00:38:33,818 --> 00:38:39,031
Reading your posts, I somehow got this
feeling that everything would go well.

584
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,830
It really gave me the confidence to continue.

585
00:38:43,118 --> 00:38:47,243
Receiving all your prayers and encouragement,

586
00:38:47,243 --> 00:38:51,660
I think I was able to grow a little.

587
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:55,737
Your support was what allowed me to change.

588
00:38:57,777 --> 00:39:05,914
These past several days seemed both so short and so fast...

589
00:39:05,959 --> 00:39:09,503
It's a strange feeling.

590
00:39:09,503 --> 00:39:12,437
So thank you.

591
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:16,247
For all your precious feelings,

592
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,941
thank you so very much.

593
00:39:21,956 --> 00:39:26,903
I'm going to give this everything I have.

594
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,935
It's me.

595
00:39:50,059 --> 00:39:54,556
I want us to get together again.

596
00:39:56,687 --> 00:40:03,147
I remembered what it was like back when we first met.

597
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:07,902
How precious you were to me back then.

598
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:18,751
I can't hear what it is, you're saying.

599
00:40:44,977 --> 00:40:46,886
All right.

600
00:40:50,397 --> 00:40:51,326
Wash face.

601
00:40:53,738 --> 00:40:55,435
If you're using a shaver, use it here.

602
00:40:57,282 --> 00:40:58,411
Trim nose hair.

603
00:40:59,413 --> 00:41:00,666
Clean ears.

604
00:41:03,932 --> 00:41:07,726
Don't use too much wax!  Just blend it in lightly.

605
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:14,851
4. Get Dressed
Put on cologne here.  Careful not to put on too much!!

606
00:41:27,181 --> 00:41:28,274
Give it here.

607
00:41:28,967 --> 00:41:30,458
The cologne.

608
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,896
Now just rub your wrists together.

609
00:41:41,203 --> 00:41:42,461
This is it?

610
00:41:42,949 --> 00:41:44,653
How much did you put on yesterday?

611
00:41:45,828 --> 00:41:47,287
I don't know who you're going to meet,

612
00:41:47,619 --> 00:41:50,977
but if you put on that much, they'll hate you instead.

613
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:54,082
I heard I'm such an Otaku, you can smell it.

614
00:41:54,082 --> 00:41:55,791
Are you that dense?

615
00:41:55,791 --> 00:41:57,629
They didn't mean you actually smell.

616
00:41:57,629 --> 00:42:00,408
Just that you wreck the atmosphere wherever you go.

617
00:42:00,565 --> 00:42:02,292
That's what it was.

618
00:42:03,776 --> 00:42:04,984
Hey,

619
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:09,573
Do I still look like an Otaku?

620
00:42:12,338 --> 00:42:14,227
It's ok, I guess.

621
00:42:23,005 --> 00:42:25,519
I'm leaving my house now.

622
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:28,224
Thanks for everything.

623
00:42:29,347 --> 00:42:34,504
I'll be sure to post as soon as I get back.

624
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:03,544
Only an hour left!

625
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:13,293
She'll come.  She won't.

626
00:44:14,236 --> 00:44:16,372
She'll come.

627
00:44:19,884 --> 00:44:21,866
She won't.

628
00:46:16,985 --> 00:46:18,711
Next Episode

629
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:49,398
This piece of fiction is based on a true story.
