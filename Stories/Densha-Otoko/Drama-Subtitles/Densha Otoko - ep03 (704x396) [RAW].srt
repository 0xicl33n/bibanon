1
00:00:15,112 --> 00:00:17,635
I, I'm glad to see you again.

2
00:00:17,635 --> 00:00:19,691
Thank you so much on the train.

3
00:00:19,691 --> 00:00:21,578
Not at all.

4
00:00:23,347 --> 00:00:27,313
Uh.. How do I look?

5
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:30,065
I think it suits you.

6
00:00:30,065 --> 00:00:30,894
Really?

7
00:00:31,244 --> 00:00:32,210
Yes.

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,752
I actually wasn't wearing my contacts that day,

9
00:00:35,752 --> 00:00:38,613
so I couldn't really see you.

10
00:00:39,074 --> 00:00:41,767
S, so you couldn't tell that I was an Ota-

11
00:00:42,779 --> 00:00:44,364
how I looked that day?

12
00:00:44,364 --> 00:00:46,060
Not very well.

13
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,108
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:48,108 --> 00:00:50,076
No- not at all.

15
00:00:50,076 --> 00:00:52,417
All right, all right.

16
00:00:54,692 --> 00:00:58,685
Nothing, it was something else I was thinking about.

17
00:00:58,685 --> 00:01:00,188
Shall we go?

18
00:01:00,188 --> 00:01:03,334
Ok.

19
00:01:12,126 --> 00:01:14,671
Aww, when's Densha Otoko going to be back?

20
00:01:14,671 --> 00:01:18,002
A first date huh?  I hope it's going well.

21
00:01:18,002 --> 00:01:22,174
Maybe he's...or could it be the're...

22
00:01:22,174 --> 00:01:25,281

I just got back.

Densha's back!

00:02:00,693 --> 00:02:02,325
He's back!!

29
00:02:02,325 --> 00:02:05,474
Do you know how long I've been waiting?
Hurry up and tell us how it went!

30
00:02:05,574 --> 00:02:07,284
Tell us the details.

31
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:12,497
I'll tell you what happened, as I relive it in my mind.

The Train Man

33
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:23,848
[We were supposed to meet at the station at 7.
I got more and more nervous as the time passed.
7 o'clock rolled by and still she wasn't there.
It was 5 after, when she arrived...

34
00:02:24,792 --> 00:02:26,382
There's a lot of people out.

35
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:29,496
Weekend's are always like this.

36
00:02:29,496 --> 00:02:31,475
I was incredibly nervous,

37
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:34,163
just walking beside a woman.

38
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:39,090
When I tried to walk like normal,
I kept leaving her behind.

39
00:02:40,263 --> 00:02:43,439
Trying to match her pace,

40
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:46,464
I think I was walking all stilted.

41
00:02:47,656 --> 00:02:49,019
And the thing is,

42
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:52,105
she looked even cuter than last time.

43
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:55,781
She actually did dress up for this.

44
00:03:01,656 --> 00:03:07,128
I thought it would look odd, a guy like me,
and a girl like her being together.

45
00:03:07,163 --> 00:03:09,064
I was so worried.

46
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,429
She's so much taller than me too.

47
00:03:11,429 --> 00:03:15,589
I thought everyone around us was staring.

48
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:16,949
There were just so many people,

49
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:19,013
and my pace was all off.

50
00:03:19,013 --> 00:03:23,718
And it was then when I turned back for the third time...

51
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:34,080
It's ok.

52
00:03:36,429 --> 00:03:38,269
I'm holding on.

53
00:03:46,999 --> 00:03:48,335
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:48,335 --> 00:03:51,095
Uhh..  no no.  It's ok.

55
00:03:51,095 --> 00:03:53,295
Why did you let go?

56
00:03:53,295 --> 00:03:55,772
Let her hold on to you.

57
00:03:55,772 --> 00:03:58,975
I'm holding on, I'm holding on,

58
00:03:58,975 --> 00:04:00,684
I'm holding on!!

59
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,191
Hermes, you rule!

60
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:04,991
Shall we go?

61
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:06,960
Ok.

62
00:04:27,672 --> 00:04:31,411
This store has a nice atmosphere doesn't it?

63
00:04:31,446 --> 00:04:33,526
I like it a lot too.

64
00:04:36,663 --> 00:04:38,919
Do you have any recommendations here?

65
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:40,147
Today our-

66
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:43,736
Um-

67
00:04:43,736 --> 00:04:46,320
I'd recommend the guinea fowl with grilled seasonal vegetables,

68
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,018
the rock-salt baked Iberico Pork,

69
00:04:49,018 --> 00:04:51,796
and also the crunchy potato and ox-tongue salad.

70
00:04:51,797 --> 00:04:52,920
It's what I usually have.

71
00:04:53,183 --> 00:04:54,167
Then I'll go with that.

72
00:04:54,167 --> 00:04:56,292
Ok.  And to drink?

73
00:04:56,511 --> 00:04:58,412
I'll have a vodka tonic with grapefruit.

74
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,609
And I'll have a...

75
00:05:01,609 --> 00:05:02,788
vodka tonic with kyohou grapes.

76
00:05:02,788 --> 00:05:05,257
Ok.  Your order will be here shortly.

77
00:05:06,358 --> 00:05:08,388
Uh, is there something wrong?

78
00:05:08,388 --> 00:05:10,604
I thought you wouldn't drink.

79
00:05:10,604 --> 00:05:12,819
Oh, I'm sorry.  You didn't have to join me.

80
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:17,247
No, no.  I like a bit of alcohol, so it was actually good.

81
00:05:21,564 --> 00:05:24,790
So everyone, this is what is date is like?

82
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,640
This is a date?!

83
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,237
Densha's so without guile,
it's so easy to cheer for him.

84
00:05:30,237 --> 00:05:35,565
Oh man... Hermes is such a nice girl!!

85
00:05:35,565 --> 00:05:37,540
Raaawwwk!

86
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,671
And the conversation?
What did you talk about?

87
00:05:39,671 --> 00:05:44,405
We talked about a lot of things,
but I was so nervous I don't remember.

88
00:05:44,405 --> 00:05:47,703
I think it was mostly about what happened on the train.

89
00:05:51,408 --> 00:05:54,542
But it was around the time we finished eating...

90
00:05:54,542 --> 00:05:58,711
Yamada-san, do you go to stores like this often?

91
00:05:58,711 --> 00:06:01,967
It's only recently that I became interested in restaurants.

92
00:06:01,967 --> 00:06:04,054
Really?

93
00:06:04,054 --> 00:06:09,174
I often go looking for good stores like this
with a friend from work.

94
00:06:10,231 --> 00:06:12,454
I see.

95
00:06:15,912 --> 00:06:19,426
Then, have you been to the Taillevent Robuchon?

96
00:06:19,157 --> 00:06:22,764
Yes.  It's now called Joel Robuchon isn't it?

97
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:24,288
J, J, Joel?

98
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:28,032
How about La Tour D'Argent?

99
00:06:28,032 --> 00:06:30,455
The duck there is great isn't it?

100
00:06:30,455 --> 00:06:32,056
You seem to know a lot of good stores.

101
00:06:32,335 --> 00:06:35,263
Not really, I've really only heard about them.

102
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:40,086
My friend recently got a new boyfriend though,

103
00:06:40,296 --> 00:06:44,041
so I haven't been able to eat out like this for a while.

104
00:06:45,777 --> 00:06:49,439
So I really enjoyed being with you tonight.

105
00:06:50,976 --> 00:06:56,416
I really enjoyed being with you,
I really enjoyed being with you,
I really enjoyed being with you.

106
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,873
Going good there, going good~

107
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:03,545
Man, it's going so well I'm getting jealous.

108
00:07:03,895 --> 00:07:06,735
But it was then that it happened...

109
00:07:06,735 --> 00:07:10,344
So what do you do in your free time?

110
00:07:10,344 --> 00:07:12,248
Uhh, in my free time?

111
00:07:12,248 --> 00:07:13,345
Yes.

112
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,217
Yay! You fell for it!

113
00:07:19,217 --> 00:07:21,058
It was a joker.

114
00:07:21,903 --> 00:07:23,049
Yamada-shi, smile!

115
00:07:23,567 --> 00:07:25,279
Congratulations!!

116
00:07:45,838 --> 00:07:48,199
I do a bit of surfing on the net.

117
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:49,830
Wow, that's wonderful!

118
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,112
I've heard it's really hard.

119
00:07:52,967 --> 00:07:54,574
It's not really, if you get used to it.

120
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,416
So how long have you been doing it?

121
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:57,936
Around 5 years now.

122
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:00,547
Then you must be an expert by now.

123
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:01,839
Is there some trick to it?

124
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,102
How you position your fingers...

125
00:08:03,102 --> 00:08:04,742
I thought it would be your stance.

126
00:08:04,742 --> 00:08:06,747
Your stance has nothing to do with it.

127
00:08:06,747 --> 00:08:08,160
I can do it lying down.

128
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,999
Isn't that really hard to do?

129
00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:14,951
I also go to the beach a lot,
but I've never seen anyone riding lying down.

130
00:08:14,986 --> 00:08:15,767
Huh?

131
00:08:15,767 --> 00:08:18,056
I really admire anyone who can surf.

132
00:08:22,136 --> 00:08:23,479
Surfing...

133
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:25,687
What should I do?

134
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:38,177
Umm...

135
00:08:38,177 --> 00:08:39,823
Any ideas?

136
00:08:39,823 --> 00:08:41,609
That's a pretty tall order...

137
00:08:41,609 --> 00:08:45,297
Asking us about a healthy outdoor sport is really pushing it...

138
00:08:45,297 --> 00:08:49,300
Yeah, it must be really hard seeing her smile
when she says that.

139
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:00,775
We later left the store and headed for the station.

140
00:09:00,775 --> 00:09:03,906
I'd been running these scenarios through my head where

141
00:09:03,906 --> 00:09:09,707
we'd head to the next store,
and decide what nicknames we'd use for each other.

142
00:09:10,587 --> 00:09:14,538
So it hurt to think of leaving her for the night.

143
00:09:14,538 --> 00:09:16,303
I was feeling miserable.

144
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,649
"I'd like to see you again."

145
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:21,160
I wanted to say it, but I couldn't.

146
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,514
So we walked in silence to the station.

147
00:09:25,514 --> 00:09:30,861
I think that time, I was able to match her pace.

148
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:39,917
Usually,

149
00:09:39,917 --> 00:09:44,882
I think people would ignore what happened on the train.

150
00:09:44,882 --> 00:09:46,649
I don't know about that.

151
00:09:46,649 --> 00:09:49,695
But you helped me.

152
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:58,527
I'm still not sure what I did was correct.

153
00:10:00,091 --> 00:10:01,646
Even if I hadn't done anything,

154
00:10:01,646 --> 00:10:04,769
that man might have done nothing further.

155
00:10:05,591 --> 00:10:08,549
What you did was correct.

156
00:10:12,749 --> 00:10:15,825
I'm really thankful for what you did.

157
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:23,126
You really are an honest person.

158
00:10:23,744 --> 00:10:27,349
I know that now, after today.

159
00:10:27,349 --> 00:10:29,462
That's not so true.

160
00:10:30,315 --> 00:10:34,483
With you here, I'm not afraid of riding the train.

161
00:10:45,426 --> 00:10:46,347
Um.

162
00:10:51,154 --> 00:10:53,677
The next stop's mine.

163
00:10:55,451 --> 00:10:57,052
Thank you for today.

164
00:10:57,617 --> 00:11:00,509
No, no  I should be thanking you.

165
00:11:18,531 --> 00:11:19,917
Good night.

166
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,380
Um.

167
00:11:46,645 --> 00:11:49,043
I'll call you.

168
00:11:51,296 --> 00:11:55,824
It came out on impulse.

169
00:11:58,116 --> 00:12:01,066
I don't know whether she heard me,

170
00:12:05,751 --> 00:12:08,900
but I thought I saw her nod.

171
00:12:37,862 --> 00:12:41,385
It's like some teenage drama.

172
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:44,821
This goes way beyond my imagination.

173
00:12:44,821 --> 00:12:48,156
What's this water coming out of my eyes?

174
00:12:48,156 --> 00:12:49,525
Salt water?

175
00:12:49,525 --> 00:12:51,102
Why...?

176
00:12:51,336 --> 00:12:53,182
So, did you call her?

177
00:12:55,891 --> 00:12:58,320
No, not yet.

178
00:12:59,353 --> 00:13:02,117
I don't even know if she heard me.

179
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:06,670
So is this the end?

180
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:09,800
This is the end.  If she liked you, she would have called.

181
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,094
Can you let it end?  What does your heart tell you?

182
00:13:13,094 --> 00:13:16,024
It's late.  You should think about it properly tomorrow.

183
00:13:16,024 --> 00:13:19,991
It's been an honour knowing someone
who's gone on a fancy date like you have.

184
00:13:19,991 --> 00:13:21,530
It's all down to how you feel.

185
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:24,160
What are you saying after all that's happened?

186
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,901
You're calling her tomorrow.

187
00:13:48,585 --> 00:13:49,650
So how was it yesterday?

188
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,146
Was he like Tom Cruise?

189
00:13:51,146 --> 00:13:54,162
Well...not completely unlike him.

190
00:13:54,162 --> 00:13:55,971
Oh, so not even close huh?

191
00:13:55,971 --> 00:13:58,354
So you're done with him right?

192
00:13:58,354 --> 00:13:59,001
Hm?

193
00:13:59,001 --> 00:14:00,331
Well of course you are.

194
00:14:00,331 --> 00:14:04,795
If you see him after this, he'll think you like him or something.

195
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:05,395
Really?

196
00:14:05,395 --> 00:14:07,291
Definitely.

197
00:14:08,104 --> 00:14:10,571
Did you already say you'd see him again?

198
00:14:10,571 --> 00:14:11,507
That's good.

199
00:14:11,507 --> 00:14:12,853
You have to be careful around men.

200
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:15,068
How about you?  How is it going with your new guy?

201
00:14:15,068 --> 00:14:16,836
That's it, back to work.

202
00:14:16,836 --> 00:14:18,803
Back to work?

203
00:14:18,803 --> 00:14:21,149
Wow, but she has an awesome butt.

204
00:14:22,539 --> 00:14:25,420
I took you to dinner just once,
quit acting like you're my girlfriend.

205
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,397
It's annoying.

206
00:14:27,397 --> 00:14:29,364
It's annoying, how you phrased that.

207
00:14:29,364 --> 00:14:30,373
Ok.

208
00:14:30,373 --> 00:14:33,597
I don't want to see you again.

209
00:14:33,597 --> 00:14:35,524
You're ugly.

210
00:14:35,524 --> 00:14:37,829
It's ugly, this cartoon you drew.

211
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:39,117
Ow, my finger, my finger.

212
00:14:39,117 --> 00:14:40,892
What are you think of?

213
00:14:40,892 --> 00:14:43,244
What are you thinking of, drawing a pictures like that.

214
00:14:43,244 --> 00:14:44,453
I'm sorry.

215
00:14:44,453 --> 00:14:47,096
I thought it would be relaxing.

216
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:48,548
You're pretty good.

217
00:14:49,476 --> 00:14:51,437
I'm actually really tired.

218
00:14:51,437 --> 00:14:54,389
You should be.  But we're live here!
Everyone's come out for you!

219
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:55,741
Thanks everyone!

220
00:14:55,741 --> 00:14:56,470
Yay, hooray!

221
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,509
Let's get this going!

222
00:14:57,509 --> 00:14:59,453
Sorry I'm late.

223
00:14:59,453 --> 00:15:01,798
You should have quit work early.

224
00:15:01,798 --> 00:15:04,198
I left Nagoya last night,

225
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:06,783
and stayed up all night to keep this spot.

226
00:15:06,783 --> 00:15:08,683
That's incredible.

227
00:15:09,138 --> 00:15:10,326
Here we go!

228
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,309
Our first caller is in need of advice.

229
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:15,927
I'm an anime otaku that loves Akihabara more than anything.

230
00:15:15,927 --> 00:15:19,249
I really like this one girl, but we have nothing in common.

231
00:15:19,493 --> 00:15:22,444
Is there hope for someone like me?

232
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:25,287
He should be ashamed, not having pride in being an otaku.

233
00:15:25,287 --> 00:15:29,093
It takes time before you stop caring how people think of you.

234
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:33,246
I like people who can lose themselves in a hobby.

235
00:15:34,156 --> 00:15:39,111
How about people who have posters
and anime figures all around the house?

236
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:41,711
That's a bit of a problem.

237
00:15:41,711 --> 00:15:43,575
It'd be ok if it was games though.

238
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:46,181
I'd like to learn how to play them too.

239
00:15:46,181 --> 00:15:50,075
Ok then, here's a question for you.

240
00:15:50,428 --> 00:15:54,560
Karin, do you think you could date this Otaku?

241
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,519
My friend was saying,

242
00:15:55,741 --> 00:15:59,724
and this is really a friend we're talking about,
but she was saying...

243
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,768
She was saying...

244
00:16:01,768 --> 00:16:03,536
Repulsive,

245
00:16:03,536 --> 00:16:06,116
gross,

246
00:16:06,116 --> 00:16:08,166
annoying,

247
00:16:09,332 --> 00:16:10,840
Do your worst...

248
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,375
Impossible, totally wrong.

249
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:16,321
For country and emperor.

250
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:18,422
Repulsive.

251
00:16:18,422 --> 00:16:18,919
Gross.

252
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:19,518
Annoying.

253
00:16:19,518 --> 00:16:21,698
impossible, totally wrong.

254
00:16:22,967 --> 00:16:24,567
See you next week!

255
00:16:29,942 --> 00:16:31,271
I'm back.

256
00:16:31,271 --> 00:16:32,858
Oh, you're here.

257
00:16:34,872 --> 00:16:37,134
So what's wrong, you look down.

258
00:16:37,134 --> 00:16:38,807
Nothing.

259
00:16:38,807 --> 00:16:39,872
Where's Mom?

260
00:16:39,872 --> 00:16:40,735
She's taking a bath.

261
00:16:40,735 --> 00:16:42,088
No peeking.

262
00:16:42,088 --> 00:16:43,879
I won't.

263
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:45,455
Did anything happen?

264
00:16:45,455 --> 00:16:47,046
Not really.

265
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,807
Actually I was wondering,

266
00:16:49,807 --> 00:16:52,480
how did you and Mom start going out?

267
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,921
What is it, all of a sudden?

268
00:16:54,921 --> 00:16:56,600
I want to know too.

269
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,160
Anyway you look at it, you two have nothing in common.

270
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,144
That's a little harsh don't you think?

271
00:17:03,144 --> 00:17:09,597
It's true I had to call her everyday,
to try to get through to her.

272
00:17:09,632 --> 00:17:11,241
You called her everyday?

273
00:17:11,241 --> 00:17:12,888
Yep.

274
00:17:12,888 --> 00:17:15,681
Well, I was really shy back then,

275
00:17:15,681 --> 00:17:18,255
so I always hung up before I couldn't say anything.

276
00:17:18,466 --> 00:17:19,646
Silent phonecalls?

277
00:17:19,793 --> 00:17:21,305
That's not all.

278
00:17:21,305 --> 00:17:25,272
I hung around her house, guarding her for 3 days straight.

279
00:17:25,272 --> 00:17:29,633
I also bullied her boyfriend, until he got depressed.

280
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:31,610
Yeah, I did a lot of things back then.

281
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,170
You were a stalker?

282
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,681
I obviously asked the wrong person here.

283
00:17:34,681 --> 00:17:37,721
You were lucky the laws were less strick back then huh?

284
00:17:37,721 --> 00:17:41,614
Hm?  Wha? Why's that?

285
00:17:42,226 --> 00:17:43,694
How can you say that?

286
00:17:44,506 --> 00:17:46,962
Doesn't it matter how I feel?

287
00:17:46,962 --> 00:17:48,602
Now stop calling me!

288
00:17:51,745 --> 00:17:52,886
Welcome back.

289
00:17:52,886 --> 00:17:54,026
Was it Father?

290
00:17:54,026 --> 00:17:55,560
I'm having some tea.

291
00:17:56,536 --> 00:17:58,758
Ok.

292
00:17:58,758 --> 00:18:01,785
You'll regret it if you date someone your parents don't like.

293
00:18:01,785 --> 00:18:03,839
Are you talking about yourself?

294
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:06,848
You know I can only teach by example.

295
00:18:06,848 --> 00:18:09,047
You're awfully hard on your yourself.

296
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:10,756
You could be right.

297
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,647
But you know,

298
00:18:12,647 --> 00:18:15,688
that's why I don't want you to become like me.

299
00:18:15,688 --> 00:18:16,832
Then that's ok.

300
00:18:16,832 --> 00:18:19,569
I don't plan on dating for a while.

301
00:18:19,569 --> 00:18:21,832
It's not ok.

302
00:18:21,832 --> 00:18:23,953
Don't you ever plan on marrying?

303
00:18:23,953 --> 00:18:25,289
It's been two years already.

304
00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:27,536
How long are you going to drag this on?

305
00:18:27,536 --> 00:18:30,293
Isn't it time you got over him?

306
00:18:30,293 --> 00:18:33,140
I know he decieved you, and you were hurt badly,

307
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,216
but it's your fault you didn't-

308
00:18:34,216 --> 00:18:35,588
Stop it.

309
00:18:35,588 --> 00:18:37,896
You don't know what happened.

310
00:18:37,896 --> 00:18:39,977
Then tell me so I do understand.

311
00:18:39,977 --> 00:18:41,569
I don't want to talk about it with you.

312
00:18:41,569 --> 00:18:43,369
Saori?

313
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:11,465
So how's it going?  I still haven't called yet.

314
00:19:12,913 --> 00:19:16,713
I can't help thinking she'll think I'm a bother.

315
00:19:16,713 --> 00:19:17,963
I know how you feel,

316
00:19:17,963 --> 00:19:20,877
but it'll be rude not calling after saying you would.

317
00:19:20,877 --> 00:19:23,494
The more you wait, the harder it's going to be.

318
00:19:23,494 --> 00:19:25,570
Out of rounds huh?

319
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,071
I'm a girl,

320
00:19:27,071 --> 00:19:28,694
but don't you think Hermes-san is waiting for you

321
00:19:28,694 --> 00:19:33,034
to ask her if she wants to go restaurant hunting with you?

322
00:19:33,836 --> 00:19:36,726
That's too good to be true.

323
00:19:43,155 --> 00:19:44,691
Isn't it?

324
00:19:47,027 --> 00:19:49,541
Is there any chance for this?

325
00:19:49,984 --> 00:19:50,618
I'd say so.

326
00:19:50,935 --> 00:19:53,249
It's the first thing I'd think of.

327
00:19:53,249 --> 00:19:56,223
Everyone's sure things will turn out well.

328
00:19:56,223 --> 00:19:58,282
That's why we're telling you to call her.

329
00:19:58,282 --> 00:20:00,832
Was that how it was.

330
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,390
Then how should I ask her?

331
00:20:04,664 --> 00:20:06,790
"If you want to have good food,"

332
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,117
"come with me."

333
00:20:09,117 --> 00:20:11,152
"I'm not good around women,"

334
00:20:11,152 --> 00:20:13,043
"but how about me?"

335
00:20:13,043 --> 00:20:15,302
Which totally lacks style.

336
00:20:15,302 --> 00:20:18,181
"I want make restaurant hunting my hobby too."

337
00:20:18,181 --> 00:20:19,128
Something like that?

338
00:20:19,128 --> 00:20:22,835
"If you're looking for a restaurant friend,
do you mind if it's me?"

339
00:20:22,835 --> 00:20:24,544
and then see how it goes.

340
00:20:27,454 --> 00:20:32,160
"If you're looking for a restaurant friend,
do you mind if it's me?"  Is that the FA?

341
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,287
Final Answer!

342
00:20:40,257 --> 00:20:41,833
All right.

343
00:20:54,658 --> 00:20:55,857
Hello?

344
00:20:56,061 --> 00:20:58,986
This is Yamada calling.

345
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:01,397
It's her.

346
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:04,228
Thank you for yesterday.

347
00:21:05,026 --> 00:21:07,356
I had a lot of fun too.

348
00:21:09,443 --> 00:21:11,779
What I said yesterday on the way back...

349
00:21:11,754 --> 00:21:13,185
I remember.

350
00:21:13,332 --> 00:21:16,542
I was wondering if you were going to call.

351
00:21:17,811 --> 00:21:20,584
Oh really?

352
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:26,646
I called t, ttoday because,

353
00:21:27,499 --> 00:21:31,531
I r, r, remebered you said you liked to look for restaurants.

354
00:21:33,615 --> 00:21:35,985
A, a, and, if it's ok with you,

355
00:21:35,985 --> 00:21:37,695
I was w, w, wwwondering

356
00:21:37,695 --> 00:21:41,650
W, w, w.   W, w, w.

357
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,065
w, would you mind it if I was your friend for that?

358
00:21:44,065 --> 00:21:45,170
Hm?

359
00:21:45,363 --> 00:21:46,713
I.. Uh..

360
00:21:46,713 --> 00:21:48,441
You seemed to find it hard to ask your friend,

361
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:50,089
so if it was ok that it's me...

362
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:52,506
Oh...

363
00:21:52,506 --> 00:21:53,867
that'd be ok.

364
00:21:54,138 --> 00:21:54,921
Huh?

365
00:21:54,921 --> 00:21:57,305
I'd like it if you would go with me.

366
00:21:57,353 --> 00:21:59,138
D, does that mean?

367
00:21:59,138 --> 00:22:01,014
It's ok?

368
00:22:01,249 --> 00:22:04,843
Yes.

369
00:22:04,843 --> 00:22:08,234
I actually wanted you to ask me that yesterday.

370
00:22:08,714 --> 00:22:13,304
I was leading you that way from the start.

371
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:17,857
Yamada-san?

372
00:22:17,857 --> 00:22:19,355
S, sorry.

373
00:22:19,355 --> 00:22:20,700
I didn't realize.

374
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,253
Don't apologize.

375
00:22:22,253 --> 00:22:24,995
I thought it would be fun if you could go with me.

376
00:22:24,995 --> 00:22:26,907
That was all.

377
00:22:26,907 --> 00:22:28,483
I'd be an honor.

378
00:22:28,483 --> 00:22:31,133
Next time it's my turn to look for a store ok?

379
00:22:32,298 --> 00:22:35,097
So how does next Sunday sound?

380
00:22:35,097 --> 00:22:37,664
I'd love to!

381
00:22:37,664 --> 00:22:40,277
Uh.. Yes.

382
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:41,999
So see you then.

383
00:22:41,999 --> 00:22:43,430
Good night.

384
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:51,111
No waay!!

385
00:22:58,438 --> 00:23:00,605
I'm seeing her again!

386
00:23:06,975 --> 00:23:12,791
Yes!!

387
00:23:36,635 --> 00:23:39,937
[Densha Otoko passes to the next level]

388
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,979
Yes, yes!

389
00:23:46,187 --> 00:23:48,159
I think I'm going to cry.

390
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,311
Densha, you're our hope,

391
00:23:50,311 --> 00:23:52,872
you're our future, you light the way.

392
00:23:57,699 --> 00:23:58,681
They're pouring in.

393
00:23:58,681 --> 00:24:00,118
I can say it here.

394
00:24:00,118 --> 00:24:02,136
I've never gone to dinner with a girl.

395
00:24:02,136 --> 00:24:06,452
When I asked, she asked me why she had to
eat dinner while looking someone as ugly as me.

396
00:24:06,938 --> 00:24:09,133
(Give us the details.  Part 2!)

397
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:23,904
She says there's a store she wants to go to,

398
00:24:23,904 --> 00:24:25,888
so that's where we're going next time.

399
00:24:25,888 --> 00:24:27,627
Thank you so much.

400
00:24:27,627 --> 00:24:29,563
Everything's moving like clockwork.

401
00:24:29,563 --> 00:24:32,882
Densha Otoko, you've passed beyond my realm...

402
00:24:32,882 --> 00:24:34,981
You guys are pampering him.

403
00:24:34,981 --> 00:24:37,201
Densha Otoko, you don't think for yourself.

404
00:24:37,237 --> 00:24:40,819
Your continued existance
just serves to create more people like you.

405
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:42,234
There's still flamers on this forum.

406
00:24:42,264 --> 00:24:43,136
Don't worry about it.

407
00:24:43,543 --> 00:24:46,552
People like you are going to be bitter for the rest of your life.

408
00:24:52,786 --> 00:24:54,588
Tezuka: Will he retire?

409
00:24:55,826 --> 00:24:58,692
6 months to full recovery, too late to return to Team Japan

410
00:25:02,018 --> 00:25:05,555
Shanghai

411
00:25:10,271 --> 00:25:11,480
Working late?

412
00:25:12,097 --> 00:25:13,711
Sakurai-san, what's going on?

413
00:25:14,271 --> 00:25:15,504
I forgot some papers.

414
00:25:15,504 --> 00:25:17,927
It's been 3 years since you left Japan isn't it?

415
00:25:17,927 --> 00:25:18,742
You're going to be busy.

416
00:25:18,742 --> 00:25:20,063
Not really.

417
00:25:21,022 --> 00:25:23,057
I might be the manager of store 1,

418
00:25:23,057 --> 00:25:25,063
but the people on site will take care of everything.

419
00:25:25,063 --> 00:25:26,483
I'll probably be bored.

420
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,112
Then how about this?

421
00:25:28,112 --> 00:25:30,114
It's this site with all these single men.

422
00:25:30,114 --> 00:25:34,247
Things are really taking off between this young otaku
and a beatiful office girl.

423
00:25:34,247 --> 00:25:35,131
Just maybe,

424
00:25:35,648 --> 00:25:38,918
we could see the most beautiful miracle in the world.

425
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:43,656
Densha Otoko
Congratulations!!

426
00:25:44,325 --> 00:25:46,329
If you want, I'll store it in your browser's favorites.

427
00:25:49,088 --> 00:25:50,791
Thank you for your business.

428
00:25:53,992 --> 00:25:56,967
World System, Research and Development Department
Jinnkama Misuzu

429
00:26:06,585 --> 00:26:07,585
Good day.

430
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,889
Jinnkama-san?

431
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:14,175
Yamada?

432
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:15,812
Yes.

433
00:26:16,698 --> 00:26:19,185
You really changed huh?  It surprised me.

434
00:26:19,185 --> 00:26:19,961
Really?

435
00:26:19,961 --> 00:26:22,248
I'm eating lunch with you aren't I?

436
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:23,713
It really surprised me too.

437
00:26:23,713 --> 00:26:25,104
I didn't think you'd do that in an elevator.

438
00:26:25,104 --> 00:26:26,368
That was just a greeting.

439
00:26:26,368 --> 00:26:27,296
A hug, a hug.

440
00:26:27,296 --> 00:26:28,695
Hug?

441
00:26:28,695 --> 00:26:30,720
I'm warning you, but that's a secret.

442
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,056
He's in the opposite camp as the manager,

443
00:26:33,056 --> 00:26:35,272
but it looks like he's moving up in the ranks.

444
00:26:35,272 --> 00:26:36,360
You had it already?

445
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,281
Well yeah.

446
00:26:37,281 --> 00:26:38,146
How was it?

447
00:26:38,146 --> 00:26:38,945
It was really good.

448
00:26:38,945 --> 00:26:40,265
It was so hot.

449
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,514
It really thick wasn't it?

450
00:26:41,514 --> 00:26:43,089
Oh yeah, it was so juicy!

451
00:26:43,089 --> 00:26:45,537
I should have ordered the Tonkatsu Meal too.

452
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:46,392
Huh?

453
00:26:47,462 --> 00:26:49,035
Oh, you were talking about that?

454
00:26:49,035 --> 00:26:50,685
What did you think I was talking about?

455
00:26:53,409 --> 00:26:54,628
Eat with this.

456
00:26:56,464 --> 00:26:57,033
So?

457
00:26:57,033 --> 00:26:59,721
Did you already do that girl you were after?

458
00:26:59,721 --> 00:27:01,305
No yet huh?

459
00:27:01,305 --> 00:27:02,442
Don't ask-

460
00:27:02,442 --> 00:27:04,370
No matter how you change on the outside,

461
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:07,209
at the most, you'll probably just be a good friend.

462
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:08,954
Do you think so?

463
00:27:08,954 --> 00:27:11,849
Things could be different if you had an interesting hobby.

464
00:27:11,849 --> 00:27:13,468
Thanks for lunch.

465
00:27:16,266 --> 00:27:18,338
A interesting hobby huh?

466
00:27:18,338 --> 00:27:21,491
I really admire anyone who can surf.

467
00:27:22,755 --> 00:27:24,084
There's one.

468
00:27:25,891 --> 00:27:27,372
You already made plans?

469
00:27:27,372 --> 00:27:32,248
I thought it would be bad asking you,
now that you have a boyfriend.

470
00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:33,817
What?  It's my fault?

471
00:27:33,927 --> 00:27:37,712
Yeah.  We're all here because you're bringing your boyfriend.

472
00:27:37,747 --> 00:27:39,196
I didn't call you.

473
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,691
Is that so?

474
00:27:40,691 --> 00:27:42,579
You're not serious are you?

475
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:43,827
What's this about?

476
00:27:43,827 --> 00:27:45,444
This has nothing to do with you.

477
00:27:45,444 --> 00:27:46,923
Aren't you being mean?

478
00:27:46,923 --> 00:27:51,163
Then let me meet him.

479
00:27:51,163 --> 00:27:55,079
I want to see if he's really the guy you say he is.

480
00:28:03,664 --> 00:28:06,034
You're so loud, I can't-

481
00:28:08,236 --> 00:28:10,812
Dad, my brother's broken!

482
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:13,926
Back, right.

483
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:19,057
Aoyama-san

484
00:28:23,223 --> 00:28:24,125
Hello?

485
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:25,948
Sorry for calling so late.

486
00:28:26,349 --> 00:28:30,601
There's someone who really wants to meet you.

487
00:28:30,901 --> 00:28:32,047
Eh?

488
00:28:32,047 --> 00:28:34,062
If it's ok,

489
00:28:34,062 --> 00:28:37,822
can we both meet you at the restaurant next time?

490
00:28:37,822 --> 00:28:40,422
Oh.. I see.

491
00:28:40,422 --> 00:28:41,302
That'll be ok.

492
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:42,454
Really?

493
00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:44,533
Yes.

494
00:28:44,533 --> 00:28:46,149
Thank you.

495
00:28:46,149 --> 00:28:48,245
I'll see you next Sunday then.

496
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:53,085
Ok, then.  Have a good night.

497
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:08,414
Wait...

498
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:10,504
This is a problem isn't it?

499
00:29:14,411 --> 00:29:17,178
There's someone who wants to meet you,

500
00:29:17,178 --> 00:29:19,683
but can we both come?  Now what?

501
00:29:19,683 --> 00:29:21,755
There's no reason to refuse.

502
00:29:21,755 --> 00:29:23,914
This one's hard to call.

503
00:29:23,914 --> 00:29:25,540
It could be a guy too.

504
00:29:26,962 --> 00:29:29,884
You're right, it could be a guy.

505
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,103
There's still time.

506
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:33,414
Call her and tell her no.

507
00:29:33,414 --> 00:29:35,316
Call her and cancel.

508
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:37,416
I can't do that, she'll hate me then.

509
00:29:37,416 --> 00:29:38,660
Refusing her also takes courage.

510
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,495
If it's a girl then she could be there to check you out.

511
00:29:40,495 --> 00:29:42,668
A woman has a really critical eye.

512
00:29:42,668 --> 00:29:44,137
Don't freak me out.

513
00:29:44,137 --> 00:29:45,386
I'm getting worried.

514
00:29:45,386 --> 00:29:46,346
Think of it as a trial.

515
00:29:46,346 --> 00:29:48,109
You're going to get caught out for sure.

516
00:29:48,109 --> 00:29:49,830
That's the plan all right.

517
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,804
Don't think too much about it.

518
00:29:50,804 --> 00:29:52,361
It could be fun.

519
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,741
It doesn't help to think negatively does it?

520
00:29:55,741 --> 00:29:58,471
If it's a guy, then at most you have a miserable time.

521
00:29:58,471 --> 00:30:01,544
What if the friend finds out you're an otaku?
What then?

522
00:30:01,579 --> 00:30:03,582
You're never going to see her again.

523
00:30:03,582 --> 00:30:05,756
Densha, what do you want to do?

524
00:30:07,923 --> 00:30:09,370
I don't know.

525
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:11,176
If I refuse, then I'll look bad.

526
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:14,173
If I go, then I'll probably mess up.

527
00:30:14,173 --> 00:30:16,181
What should I do?

528
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:19,107
What are you doing, depending on a bunch of
immature forum members?

529
00:30:19,107 --> 00:30:20,875
To them, you're just a toy.

530
00:30:20,875 --> 00:30:22,740
You're so dim you can't see it.

531
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,902
You're going to be used, and make a fool out of yourself.

532
00:30:24,902 --> 00:30:26,019
Get lost already.

533
00:30:26,019 --> 00:30:28,565
Get off the pulpit, you fool.

534
00:30:28,565 --> 00:30:31,107
We're all honestly rooting for him.

535
00:30:31,107 --> 00:30:33,465
Find some other forum to flame at.

536
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:35,401
Ignore anything this guy says.

537
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:36,598
Getting back on topic,

538
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:39,525
why don't you settle for being a friend?

539
00:30:41,118 --> 00:30:43,782
I think that's good enough.

540
00:30:43,782 --> 00:30:45,902
You're aiming that low?

541
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:47,831
It's part of being an otaku.

542
00:30:47,831 --> 00:30:49,576
Dating her is going to be tough.

543
00:30:50,185 --> 00:30:52,903
Even if she hates you for it, you should refuse.

544
00:30:52,903 --> 00:30:54,071
I agree.

545
00:30:54,071 --> 00:30:55,170
Don't try to handle too much.

546
00:30:57,479 --> 00:31:00,758
Densha, how do you feel about her?

547
00:31:17,548 --> 00:31:20,087
I'm too scared to say.

548
00:31:21,482 --> 00:31:22,279
What'd I tell ya?

549
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:24,386
He's a total loser.

550
00:31:24,386 --> 00:31:27,319
If you have time to help a loser like him,

551
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:29,603
use it to deal with society.

552
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:41,556
This is that guy from before.

553
00:31:41,556 --> 00:31:43,260
Ban him forever.

554
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:46,366
I was annoyed with Densha's lack of decisiveness too.

555
00:31:46,366 --> 00:31:48,391
Don't listen to them.

556
00:31:48,391 --> 00:31:50,558
Is there any point to this board?

557
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:52,019
This has nothing to do with you.

558
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:53,657
Densha, you're our hope.

559
00:31:53,657 --> 00:31:56,191
If you're not going to support him, get lost.

560
00:31:56,191 --> 00:32:00,567
Even if we do support him, and he does succeed,
nothing changes in our lives.

561
00:32:00,567 --> 00:32:03,279
Densha needs us.

562
00:32:03,639 --> 00:32:04,452
Ok then,

563
00:32:04,577 --> 00:32:07,151
can you take responsibility for what you tell him?

564
00:32:07,151 --> 00:32:09,006
If something goes wrong,
you're just going to slink away.

565
00:32:09,006 --> 00:32:12,501
You guys see a part of yourselves in Densha,
and are just enjoying the ride.

566
00:32:12,501 --> 00:32:15,013
What's important isn't the result,
but the what you learn through the process.

567
00:32:15,013 --> 00:32:16,944
To be honest, I don't think I could take responsibility.

568
00:32:16,944 --> 00:32:22,205
Everyone calm down.  Densha gave us all strength, didn't he?

569
00:32:22,205 --> 00:32:24,086
That's just a delusion.

570
00:32:24,086 --> 00:32:26,226
This loser doesn't have that kind of power.

571
00:32:26,226 --> 00:32:29,686
More to the point,
this whole story is probably someone's delusion.

572
00:32:29,686 --> 00:32:32,487
People like you who have no faith, will forever stay single.

573
00:32:32,487 --> 00:32:36,365
Gullible people like you will also forever stay single.

574
00:32:36,365 --> 00:32:39,822
Is there any point in a bunch of losers
trying to do something together?

575
00:32:39,822 --> 00:32:43,420
This is as far as this ragtag group can go.

576
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:46,358
Is there nothing we can do?

577
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:00,926
Hopeless single men really turn me off.

578
00:33:00,926 --> 00:33:02,181
Men are about heart.

579
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:04,314
If that's what you think then your heart's gross too.

580
00:33:04,314 --> 00:33:06,945
We're all just a bunch of ugly losers.

581
00:33:06,945 --> 00:33:09,471
So you finally realized.  Took you long enough.

582
00:33:09,471 --> 00:33:10,839
This is really dumb.

583
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:12,183
I'm leaving.

584
00:33:12,183 --> 00:33:13,838
What's this droopiness I feel?

585
00:33:13,838 --> 00:33:16,047
It's time this forum closed.

586
00:33:16,047 --> 00:33:16,967
Wait a minute.

587
00:33:16,967 --> 00:33:17,894
5 seconds to destruction.

588
00:33:17,894 --> 00:33:18,740
Bring it on.

589
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,848
I've had enough.

590
00:33:19,848 --> 00:33:21,766
Stop it already.

591
00:33:33,204 --> 00:33:36,625
I'm sorry everything got this way.

592
00:33:37,775 --> 00:33:40,686
I was depending on you guys too much.

593
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:44,119
I'll think about this on my own now.

594
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:46,487
About what I really want to do.

595
00:33:46,487 --> 00:33:49,435
I need to answer that for myself.

596
00:34:16,931 --> 00:34:18,660
So where's your boyfriend anyway?

597
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,389
He should be here soon.

598
00:34:22,315 --> 00:34:23,083
You're late.

599
00:34:23,418 --> 00:34:24,858
Sorry.

600
00:34:24,859 --> 00:34:25,755
He's cute.

601
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,865
Here, sit down.

602
00:34:28,356 --> 00:34:30,060
Your boyfriend was Keisuke?

603
00:34:30,232 --> 00:34:30,839
Is it wrong?

604
00:34:31,765 --> 00:34:33,387
How can you ask me that?  He's my-

605
00:34:33,226 --> 00:34:34,733
He doesn't belong to you either.

606
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:36,889
He's seeing both of you?

607
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:40,760
So the reason you didn't want to come was
because you were meeting Keisuke?

608
00:34:41,172 --> 00:34:42,838
I guess.

609
00:34:43,687 --> 00:34:46,110
So you two are really going out?

610
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,981
What are you talking about?

611
00:34:47,981 --> 00:34:49,493
Don't pretend you don't know anything!

612
00:34:49,493 --> 00:34:50,728
You cheater!

613
00:34:50,728 --> 00:34:51,882
I have no idea what's going on here.

614
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:53,255
But you were seeing Kaho weren't you?

615
00:34:53,255 --> 00:34:55,012
I was asking for her advice.

616
00:34:55,012 --> 00:34:55,710
Advice?

617
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:58,642
I was thinking of working for Sakurai-san.

618
00:34:59,165 --> 00:35:02,155
Then make it clear that you're only seeing Saori.

619
00:35:02,844 --> 00:35:03,837
You can't do it?

620
00:35:03,837 --> 00:35:04,853
That's impossible.

621
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,037
Well then someone's gotta do something about that.

622
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:09,022
Keisuke's my brother.

623
00:35:09,022 --> 00:35:10,149
Huh?

624
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:10,902
Keisuke, are you ok?

625
00:35:10,902 --> 00:35:11,997
Not really.

626
00:35:11,997 --> 00:35:13,558
Brothers, you mean like family?

627
00:35:13,558 --> 00:35:14,285
Yes.

628
00:35:14,285 --> 00:35:16,254
You look alike!

629
00:35:16,254 --> 00:35:19,190
You said Sakurai, but is that Kazuya you're talking about?

630
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:21,070
He's coming back to Japan.

631
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,027
Tokyo's night sky's filthy.

632
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:53,837
Densha, how do you feel about Hermes?

633
00:35:53,837 --> 00:35:55,142
Please stop.

634
00:35:55,949 --> 00:35:56,526
Stop it.

635
00:35:56,526 --> 00:35:58,537
What?

636
00:36:00,445 --> 00:36:02,718
I, I, I'm telling you to stop.

637
00:36:02,718 --> 00:36:04,720
Applause for our brave forum member.

638
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,321
You did good.

639
00:36:06,321 --> 00:36:09,449
You've definitely leveled up.

640
00:36:31,991 --> 00:36:35,418
What if the friend finds out you're an otaku?
What then?

641
00:36:35,647 --> 00:36:38,323
You're never going to see her again.

642
00:36:38,323 --> 00:36:40,930
A women has a really critical eye.

643
00:36:44,002 --> 00:36:45,220
You have Otaku written all over you.

644
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,892
From top to bottom, you're pure Otaku.

645
00:36:49,451 --> 00:36:51,428
You can leave my stuff alone.

646
00:37:11,775 --> 00:37:14,703
What you did was correct.

647
00:37:42,352 --> 00:37:44,016
Long time no see!

648
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,400
He should be ashamed, not having pride in being an otaku.

649
00:38:01,985 --> 00:38:04,914
Gentlemen, would you like to write your wishes for this year?

650
00:38:04,914 --> 00:38:07,585
I'd like to get transferred to a different division at work.

651
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:09,875
That's not the type of thing you're supposed to wish for.

652
00:38:11,954 --> 00:38:12,725
[I'd like to get transfered out of sales
Yamada Atsushi]

653
00:38:12,725 --> 00:38:15,317
What does your heart tell you?

654
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:22,795
Densha, what do you want to do?

655
00:38:25,308 --> 00:38:28,765
[LOVE]

656
00:38:47,397 --> 00:38:51,645
It's been three days since Densha left...

657
00:38:51,645 --> 00:38:55,117
All because of someone's big mouth.

658
00:38:55,117 --> 00:38:58,242
This board's sure gone quiet.

659
00:39:02,561 --> 00:39:04,863
If that's all it takes,

660
00:39:04,863 --> 00:39:07,566
he wasn't going to get far anyway.

661
00:39:09,669 --> 00:39:12,286
That goes for me too.

662
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:17,711
It's been a while hasn't it?

663
00:39:19,071 --> 00:39:20,726
Densha.

664
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:36,605
I'm going to see Hermes and her friend tomorrow.

665
00:39:36,605 --> 00:39:39,151
Based on your recommendations,

666
00:39:39,151 --> 00:39:41,607
I've decided to wear a cutsew and jeans.

667
00:39:41,607 --> 00:39:43,399
What's a cutsew?

668
00:39:44,166 --> 00:39:47,287
These past three days away from the forum,

669
00:39:47,287 --> 00:39:50,016
I've had a chance to really think.

670
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:55,280
What I found was how I really felt about Hermes-san.

671
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,500
The more I thought about her, the more anxious I got.

672
00:40:02,737 --> 00:40:06,976
I hardly know all of you,

673
00:40:06,976 --> 00:40:09,727
but you gave me courage.

674
00:40:09,727 --> 00:40:13,508
Both Hermes and this forum

675
00:40:13,508 --> 00:40:16,720
have become a part of my life.

676
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,202
I know that now.

677
00:40:19,202 --> 00:40:22,745
I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow,

678
00:40:22,745 --> 00:40:26,361
but I can tell you this;

679
00:40:26,361 --> 00:40:30,380
I'm glad it was you.

680
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:34,855
Thank you!

681
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,595
I'm going to ask you again,

682
00:40:42,595 --> 00:40:46,548
but do you love Hermes?

683
00:41:09,164 --> 00:41:12,236
[LOVE]

684
00:41:30,717 --> 00:41:34,972
Yes I do.

685
00:41:34,972 --> 00:41:42,053
I think of her all the time;
both in my dreams and when I'm awake.

686
00:41:59,989 --> 00:42:02,974
In my dreams and when I'm awake...

687
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:13,655
....Tezuka, Tezuka, Tezuka...

688
00:43:02,219 --> 00:43:05,432
Mom!  We're going to rehab!

689
00:43:16,634 --> 00:43:17,900
I'm heading out.

690
00:43:44,961 --> 00:43:46,399
You can leave my stuff alone.

691
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:17,626
Saori.

692
00:44:18,295 --> 00:44:19,897
Kaho, you're early.

693
00:44:19,897 --> 00:44:20,872
A little.

694
00:44:20,872 --> 00:44:22,530
Yamada-san?

695
00:44:25,874 --> 00:44:26,540
Hi.

696
00:44:28,464 --> 00:44:30,618
This is my friend, Sawazaki Kaho.

697
00:44:30,618 --> 00:44:32,115
Pleased to meet you.

698
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:40,336
We've met before haven't we?

699
00:46:17,209 --> 00:46:19,633
Next Week

700
00:46:47,076 --> 00:46:49,414
This piece of fiction was based on a true story.
