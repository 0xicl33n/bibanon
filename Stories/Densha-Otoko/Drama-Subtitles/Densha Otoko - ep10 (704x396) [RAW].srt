00:00:00,518 --> 00:00:02,660
Episode 10

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:03,661
What is going on?

3
00:00:03,661 --> 00:00:04,740
You look so serious

4
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,920
You were played by that man, Yamada

5
00:00:06,921 --> 00:00:06,921


6
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:08,854
That bastard

7
00:00:08,854 --> 00:00:11,273
He wrote everything about you on the internet

8
00:00:11,273 --> 00:00:13,880
The meetings with you, your trauma

9
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,243
He wrote about them funnily and made a fool out of you!

10
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:19,902
It's a lie...

11
00:00:20,566 --> 00:00:21,592
No way...

12
00:00:21,592 --> 00:00:23,737
He is the worst

13
00:00:23,737 --> 00:00:25,183
That bastard betrayed you

14
00:00:25,975 --> 00:00:25,976

15
00:00:25,976 --> 00:00:28,500
Look, things like the stalker incident

16
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:28,501

17
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:28,502

18
00:00:28,502 --> 00:00:30,076
And the divorcing of our parents

19
00:00:30,076 --> 00:00:31,728
All the embarassing things

20
00:00:31,728 --> 00:00:33,251
Are written up there!

21
00:00:33,251 --> 00:00:33,793
Please stop now

22
00:00:33,793 --> 00:00:35,585
That's not all

23
00:00:35,585 --> 00:00:39,096
Even weird imaginations and expressions about you

24
00:00:39,535 --> 00:00:42,590
Saori, it is Yamada-san

25
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,134
That bastard!

26
00:00:44,134 --> 00:00:44,974
Keisuke!

27
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,154
Good morning

28
00:00:57,886 --> 00:00:59,042
Um... What is happening?

29
00:00:59,042 --> 00:01:00,959
You made fun of my sister on the internet!

30
00:01:01,824 --> 00:01:05,956
Keisuke, stop

31
00:01:05,956 --> 00:01:07,465
Let him talk

32
00:01:14,364 --> 00:01:16,478
I heard about the forum

33
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:22,007
Written all about me...

34
00:01:22,007 --> 00:01:23,476
Is it true?

35
00:01:23,476 --> 00:01:26,495
Um... that...

36
00:01:28,395 --> 00:01:30,512
It is true

37
00:01:30,512 --> 00:01:32,809
Um... Actually...

38
00:01:32,809 --> 00:01:35,176
I came here to talk to you about it

39
00:01:35,176 --> 00:01:37,160
Did you have fun?

40
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:40,442
About me...

41
00:01:40,442 --> 00:01:45,426
Telling everyone about me... did you have fun?

42
00:01:45,426 --> 00:01:48,097
It was not for that purpose

43
00:01:48,097 --> 00:01:50,942
That forum was for...

44
00:01:50,942 --> 00:01:54,307
Because I did not know how to get to know a woman...

45
00:01:54,307 --> 00:01:56,154
I don't want to listen to you

46
00:01:57,058 --> 00:01:59,931
I was stupid to trust you

47
00:02:05,588 --> 00:02:08,442
Now

48
00:02:08,442 --> 00:02:11,164
Don't ever come see me again

49
00:02:16,831 --> 00:02:17,764
No!

50
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:21,187
You and my sister live in a different world!

51
00:02:33,614 --> 00:02:35,794
Stop it

52
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:39,227
I only tried to talk to her!

53
00:02:39,227 --> 00:02:42,456
I did not do anything weird!

54
00:02:44,821 --> 00:02:47,239
Are you okay?

55
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:49,073
Not okay...

56
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,503
I thought so

57
00:02:51,503 --> 00:02:52,981
Quiet!

58
00:02:56,884 --> 00:02:58,940
Yes yes yes yes!!

59
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,048
It is fixed!

60
00:03:04,048 --> 00:03:05,031
Fixed!

61
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:10,372
Densha, I am back!

62
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:15,314
I got dumped totally by Hermes-san

63
00:03:15,314 --> 00:03:18,729
This time, for real, it is all over.

64
00:03:19,134 --> 00:03:22,796
What happened while I was gone

[Densha Otoko]
The visions dancing in my mind

68
00:03:38,357 --> 00:03:42,140
The early dawn, the shades of time

69
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:47,480
Twilight crawling through my windowpane

70
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:52,254
Am I awake or do I dream?

71
00:03:52,254 --> 00:03:55,905
The strangest pictures I have seen

72
00:03:55,905 --> 00:03:57,351
Night is day and twilight¡¯s gone away

73
00:03:57,351 --> 00:03:59,325
We told you not to tell you about the forum!

74
00:03:59,325 --> 00:04:01,728
Densha chose to do it. We can't do anything now.

75
00:04:01,728 --> 00:04:03,786
Why didn't we try harder to stop him

76
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:04,488
Stupid!

77
00:04:04,488 --> 00:04:07,047
This forum was the reason?

78
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:11,262
By the time I got there, she already found out

79
00:04:11,262 --> 00:04:13,972
I think her brother told her

80
00:04:13,972 --> 00:04:14,948
They found out first?

81
00:04:14,948 --> 00:04:15,995
Because of the brother?!

82
00:04:15,995 --> 00:04:19,203
I didn't think the forum was known to people so close to her....

83
00:04:19,203 --> 00:04:21,472
Well, even a middle-schooler like I was involved

84
00:04:21,472 --> 00:04:22,049
Who was it!

85
00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:23,159
Who got the forum all famous?

86
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:24,715
It is you and us

87
00:04:24,715 --> 00:04:25,786
Sorry

88
00:04:25,786 --> 00:04:28,128
That means, is Hermes-san watching this right now?

89
00:04:28,128 --> 00:04:30,709
I found myself sitting straight up ever since thinking Hermes-san is watching this

90
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:32,940
Hermes-san! Haa haa~

91
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,232
No, I will go and change my clothes

92
00:04:35,232 --> 00:04:37,848
There is almost no chance of that

93
00:04:37,848 --> 00:04:41,710
Hermes-san and her brother

94
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,664
Despise the idea of this forum

95
00:04:43,664 --> 00:04:45,353
If they are biased, that can't be helped

96
00:04:45,353 --> 00:04:48,282
That is the opinion of a normal woman when facing us

97
00:04:48,282 --> 00:04:50,654
I am a little relieved... and sad...

98
00:04:50,654 --> 00:04:52,538
Then I can be relieved about writing here

99
00:04:52,538 --> 00:04:56,823
Why did she dump you when she hasn't read the forum?

100
00:04:56,823 --> 00:04:59,567
I think Hermes-san was shocked

101
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:03,095
About finding stories concerning her here

102
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:07,010
I couldn't explain anything, just got dumped

103
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,933
Then if you explain things to her, wouldn't it be okay?

104
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,051
Densha, you went to tell her about this forum!

105
00:05:11,051 --> 00:05:12,492
You can't back off now!

106
00:05:12,492 --> 00:05:13,959
Persuade her until she accepts!

107
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:16,415
Let's go to Hermes-san's house!

108
00:05:17,182 --> 00:05:18,763
I think it is impossible now

109
00:05:18,763 --> 00:05:19,770
Her brother told me...

110
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:23,444
Hermes-san and I live in a different world

111
00:05:23,444 --> 00:05:28,653
I realized a person like me should not think about going out with her

112
00:05:28,653 --> 00:05:31,733
Even if she understands about the forum

113
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:35,234
Keeping the happy relationship going

114
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:37,540
Is impossible with my abilities

115
00:05:38,481 --> 00:05:42,515
I thought throwing my otakuness away was hard enough

116
00:05:42,515 --> 00:05:43,502
But that was

117
00:05:43,502 --> 00:05:46,179
Because I didn't want her to hate me

118
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,293
Not because I wanted her to be happy

119
00:05:49,293 --> 00:05:51,196
I fully realized

120
00:05:51,196 --> 00:05:54,936
After she said to never see her again

121
00:05:54,936 --> 00:05:57,612
I finally realized that

122
00:05:58,178 --> 00:05:59,632
Now

123
00:05:59,632 --> 00:06:02,169
There is no way

124
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:03,358
To meet her

125
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,869
Bastard! Are you okay with it!

126
00:06:08,356 --> 00:06:11,220
You can still do it!

127
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:14,222
We will cheer you on!

128
00:06:31,771 --> 00:06:32,933
That's enough

129
00:06:33,624 --> 00:06:34,792
You did good

130
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:38,705
I first thought lowly of you, Densha

131
00:06:39,153 --> 00:06:42,626
Taking so long to just make one call

132
00:06:42,626 --> 00:06:47,169
I thought "All right, we will fully support him!"

133
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:48,577
But...

134
00:06:48,577 --> 00:06:51,367
You are way ahead of me now

135
00:06:51,367 --> 00:06:54,225
If you think that it is over

136
00:06:54,225 --> 00:06:56,598
Then it is over

137
00:06:56,598 --> 00:06:58,741
You did good until now

138
00:06:59,222 --> 00:07:00,505
Good job

139
00:07:00,505 --> 00:07:05,188
Singles saying things about what you decided

140
00:07:05,188 --> 00:07:07,055
Would not have any meaning anymore

141
00:07:07,055 --> 00:07:10,038
This time, it is not about lies or other things

142
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:10,991
I know it is hard for you

143
00:07:10,991 --> 00:07:13,240
But don't stop now. You can find other girls!

144
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,268
No!

145
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,293
I can't accept things ending this way!

146
00:07:16,293 --> 00:07:17,028
Densha...

147
00:07:17,028 --> 00:07:19,595
Let's go back to the origin of all single males!

148
00:07:19,595 --> 00:07:21,440
Densha Otoko!

149
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:21,862
I am sad!

150
00:07:21,862 --> 00:07:24,467
Even a novice like I was on stand-by constructing shelters

151
00:07:24,467 --> 00:07:25,812
Me too, me too

152
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,783
Try one more time!

153
00:07:27,783 --> 00:07:28,988
Good job

154
00:07:28,988 --> 00:07:31,132
You gave us courage

155
00:07:31,132 --> 00:07:33,612
I am gonna fail again~!

156
00:07:33,612 --> 00:07:35,734
For now, work on muscles!

157
00:07:35,734 --> 00:07:38,024
Thanks for giving me the joy of going to World Cup!

158
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:38,497
Benoist!

159
00:07:38,497 --> 00:07:40,344
Last stop...

160
00:07:40,344 --> 00:07:41,564
Last stop...

161
00:07:41,564 --> 00:07:44,222
Densha-san will be able to meet other good girls

162
00:07:44,222 --> 00:07:47,026
I've been dumped 15 times in a row

163
00:07:47,026 --> 00:07:47,441
Don't worry

164
00:07:47,441 --> 00:07:49,969
I like Densha-san

165
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:53,811
The three months I spent with Densha are treasured in my heart!

166
00:07:59,781 --> 00:08:00,888
Now

167
00:08:00,888 --> 00:08:03,767
I won't write here anymore

168
00:08:03,767 --> 00:08:07,189
But I won't forget you guys

169
00:08:08,691 --> 00:08:11,780
Thank you

170
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,944
There is nothing to do again

171
00:10:02,994 --> 00:10:06,182
Matsunaga Matsunaga?

172
00:10:06,182 --> 00:10:07,299
You mean that "sea turtle"?

173
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:08,249
Yes, but that turtle

174
00:10:08,249 --> 00:10:10,395
Was not just plain old "sea turtle"~

175
00:10:10,395 --> 00:10:12,706
It is money turtle!

176
00:10:12,706 --> 00:10:13,157
That...

177
00:10:13,157 --> 00:10:14,853
Is Nagoya's super real estate man!

178
00:10:14,853 --> 00:10:16,488
So even if he doesn't work he gets $300,000 a year!

179
00:10:16,488 --> 00:10:17,188
Can you believe it?

180
00:10:17,188 --> 00:10:19,388
There was something in the pile of dirt!

181
00:10:19,388 --> 00:10:21,501
Hey look at this

182
00:10:21,501 --> 00:10:24,542
On this unlookable face

183
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:26,679
Can you feel the rich boy smell?

184
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:29,500
Are you actually going for the "sea turtle"?

185
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,836
We decided to date after I come back from Italy

186
00:10:32,836 --> 00:10:33,951
You don't even have self-esteem?

187
00:10:33,951 --> 00:10:36,829
I gave all that away after becoming old

188
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:37,815
Sorry

189
00:10:37,815 --> 00:10:38,447
Why?

190
00:10:38,447 --> 00:10:40,529
Saori, you are late!

191
00:10:40,877 --> 00:10:42,806
Hey, here~ Ticket to Italy

192
00:10:45,836 --> 00:10:46,940
What happened?

193
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,992
You cried

194
00:10:47,992 --> 00:10:50,300
Did something happen with Yamada again?

195
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:54,282
I decided not to meet him anymore

196
00:10:54,813 --> 00:10:57,218
This time, it is the end for real

197
00:10:57,218 --> 00:10:58,576
What are you talking about?

198
00:11:02,587 --> 00:11:03,662
What happened?

199
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:06,945
Hmmm, tried playing the game of love blindly and lost

200
00:11:07,572 --> 00:11:08,542
Um

201
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,251
Yamada and Saori breaking up, is it real?

202
00:11:10,251 --> 00:11:11,041
Huh?!

203
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:11,535
They broke up?

204
00:11:11,535 --> 00:11:13,655
No not really, because they never actually went out

205
00:11:13,655 --> 00:11:16,327
Why is he giving up now, that Densha

206
00:11:16,327 --> 00:11:18,297
How much did I go through because of him...

207
00:11:19,176 --> 00:11:21,739
Huh? It doesn't matter?!

208
00:11:21,739 --> 00:11:24,352
That means, Saori is "no-mark"

209
00:11:25,111 --> 00:11:27,013
There still was "loss time"

210
00:11:28,726 --> 00:11:30,931
Hey, what happened?

211
00:11:30,931 --> 00:11:32,702
Saori never tells me

212
00:11:34,342 --> 00:11:36,234
Can we talk for a moment?

213
00:11:42,189 --> 00:11:45,040
You told your sister about the forum, right?

214
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,448
What did you say?

215
00:11:46,448 --> 00:11:48,084
I said everything as it is

216
00:11:48,084 --> 00:11:51,291
Tell me how you said everything as it is

217
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:02,710
I am telling you to tell me!

218
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,967
Character is totally different!

219
00:12:05,873 --> 00:12:07,741
This is the real one

220
00:12:07,741 --> 00:12:11,962
That bastard made a fool out of my sister in all of Japan

221
00:12:11,962 --> 00:12:12,539
He enjoyed doing that

222
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:14,649
Did you even read the forum?

223
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:16,426
No, and I don't want to

224
00:12:16,955 --> 00:12:18,640
Damn it

225
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,680
This is why I hate kids

226
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,085
What is that attitude?

227
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,062
Read the forum

228
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,733
What is...

229
00:12:30,038 --> 00:12:33,207
Hey, what do you mean? A forum?

230
00:12:33,207 --> 00:12:34,053
Sorry...

231
00:12:35,726 --> 00:12:36,735
Misuzu-san!

232
00:12:37,016 --> 00:12:38,098
Aladdin~

233
00:12:38,098 --> 00:12:39,360
Channel~

234
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,510
Saori~

235
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,680
And Yamada~ Ha~

236
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,244
The reason~

237
00:12:43,244 --> 00:12:44,820
For breaking up~

238
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,864
Written~

239
00:12:45,864 --> 00:12:47,735
Right there~ Ha~

240
00:12:47,735 --> 00:12:49,724
Look at this poor man~

241
00:12:50,585 --> 00:12:52,205
We are going there to research the market

242
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:56,029
But it is still Italy, so I hope this lightens you up

243
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:58,922
Sorry

244
00:12:58,922 --> 00:13:00,649
I drank too much last night

245
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:01,757
So late!

246
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,871
Let's go!

247
00:13:08,005 --> 00:13:09,017
Yamada, this stupid bastard

248
00:13:09,017 --> 00:13:11,115
Absent for three days

249
00:13:11,115 --> 00:13:11,819
Ah, ok. Let's fire him!

250
00:13:11,819 --> 00:13:13,781
Fire him!

251
00:13:15,792 --> 00:13:17,389
Ah this is it

252
00:13:18,295 --> 00:13:19,371
Ah, is this Yamada-kun's mother?

253
00:13:19,371 --> 00:13:21,147
My name is Kuroki, Yamada-kun's company superior

254
00:13:21,147 --> 00:13:22,314
Is Yamada-kun there?

255
00:13:22,314 --> 00:13:24,540
Yes, yes, I want him to write me a letter of resignation

256
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,748
Yes yes yes

257
00:13:25,748 --> 00:13:27,073
Ah, disconnected

258
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,560
Yes? Oikawa-kun?

259
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,056
I like him

260
00:13:33,056 --> 00:13:35,737
Even if it is you, Oikawa-kun, your preference

261
00:13:35,737 --> 00:13:38,146
Interfering is not acceptable

262
00:13:38,146 --> 00:13:40,481
Oh well, then

263
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,253
Wh..at?

264
00:13:46,704 --> 00:13:47,822
Yes

265
00:13:49,106 --> 00:13:50,467
Jinnkama-san

266
00:13:50,467 --> 00:13:51,220
What brings you here?

267
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,822
Get me some tea

268
00:13:57,815 --> 00:13:59,181
You got dumped?

269
00:14:01,121 --> 00:14:01,668
How do you...

270
00:14:01,668 --> 00:14:03,731
No just I heard it from someone

271
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,343
Ah really?

272
00:14:06,343 --> 00:14:10,159
But from the beginning, it wasn't possible for you to go out with her

273
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:16,290
See, it is Otaku and a Queen

274
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:20,527
It is worse than the Beauty and the Beast

275
00:14:25,563 --> 00:14:27,065
Ahhhhhh I can't keep it down anymore!

276
00:14:27,065 --> 00:14:28,655
This gloomy atmosphere!

277
00:14:29,549 --> 00:14:30,579
Take off your clothes!

278
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:31,679
Huh?

279
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,214
Well, I share the responsibility for what happened

280
00:14:35,077 --> 00:14:36,210
Oh well

281
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,184
Huh?

282
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:40,067
They say breaking-up is the beginning of new love

283
00:14:40,067 --> 00:14:41,575
What are you doing?

284
00:14:41,575 --> 00:14:42,859
Be quiet!

285
00:14:42,859 --> 00:14:44,290
Stay still!

286
00:14:44,778 --> 00:14:46,092
Please, no...

287
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:49,162
Until when are you going to keep this going?

288
00:14:49,162 --> 00:14:51,844
There are so many girls like that in this world

289
00:14:51,844 --> 00:14:53,389
There aren't any!

290
00:14:54,943 --> 00:14:58,189
There aren't any awesome girls like her!

291
00:15:01,052 --> 00:15:02,531
Am I not different?

292
00:15:03,438 --> 00:15:06,068
Then I will teach you with my body

293
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:13,621
Excuse me

294
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,754
No, excuse me

295
00:15:14,754 --> 00:15:16,300
Sorry

296
00:15:30,285 --> 00:15:30,806
Kaho

297
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:32,657
What are you doing?

298
00:15:32,923 --> 00:15:34,888
Ah, yes. Um...

299
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:36,864
Ah, it came!

300
00:15:36,864 --> 00:15:38,094
Wow, it looks so good

301
00:15:38,094 --> 00:15:39,072
Looks so tasty!

302
00:15:46,348 --> 00:15:48,513
Now I can finally talk

303
00:15:51,561 --> 00:15:54,542
I was away from the forum for some reason

304
00:15:54,542 --> 00:15:55,974
But now I am up to date

305
00:15:55,974 --> 00:15:58,815
Looks like Densha got rejected

306
00:15:58,815 --> 00:16:01,331
But, so sleepy!

307
00:16:01,331 --> 00:16:03,511
So few people! It is Safari!

308
00:16:03,511 --> 00:16:05,798
Well, the main character is gone now, so there will be no audience

309
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,969
Why did you guys let Densha go with unfinished business?

310
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:12,411
This way, he won't have changed at all

311
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,592
Densha closed the curtain himself

312
00:16:17,592 --> 00:16:20,190
He was the finest weapon of our army

313
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:22,102
And... became a star

314
00:16:22,102 --> 00:16:24,635
He took a heavy blow

315
00:16:24,635 --> 00:16:29,103
But all of us would have hoped for his love to come true

316
00:16:29,103 --> 00:16:31,673
We know already, we don't need to hear that from a novice like you

317
00:16:31,673 --> 00:16:33,500
There are many things that can't be helped

318
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,435
That, also true

319
00:16:34,435 --> 00:16:37,672
We think we did all we could

320
00:16:37,672 --> 00:16:40,388
I am also not sure that things will work out

321
00:16:40,388 --> 00:16:41,366
But

322
00:16:41,366 --> 00:16:43,519
I don't want any regrets

323
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,332
He never told Hermes-san how he actually feels

324
00:16:47,332 --> 00:16:50,770
He can give up after he tells her

325
00:16:52,287 --> 00:16:54,129
But it is too late now

326
00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:57,308
Densha will never come back to this forum

327
00:16:57,308 --> 00:17:01,507
We are only connected through the net

328
00:17:01,507 --> 00:17:04,227
That is why we are called singles

329
00:17:04,227 --> 00:17:08,165
Unless we change, we can't hope to change Densha's mind!

330
00:17:08,165 --> 00:17:11,058
Is there anyone that will get him to come here

331
00:17:11,058 --> 00:17:15,357
And tell him to confess!! Anyone!!!

332
00:17:21,614 --> 00:17:22,698
No use telling us that now

333
00:17:22,698 --> 00:17:25,276
I also am mad at how things are

334
00:17:25,276 --> 00:17:26,624
But Densha being like that...

335
00:17:26,624 --> 00:17:28,196
Should I try?

336
00:17:28,196 --> 00:17:30,357
Heyhey! It is only hurting Densha again?!

337
00:17:30,357 --> 00:17:31,798
No!!!!

338
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:35,280
It is us running away because we were afraid of getting hurt

339
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,606
Densha is our final weapon

340
00:17:37,606 --> 00:17:40,796
You are thinking wrong. He met his limits

341
00:17:40,796 --> 00:17:42,235
Did you forget?

342

The danger of that demolition weapon?

343
00:17:43,986 --> 00:17:46,278
If we don't support Densha, who will?

344
00:17:46,278 --> 00:17:48,625
It's ok. The guys who want to support Densha once more can stay

345
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:49,363
Ha...

Cheers to you all trying to hurry and get to work!

348

It is time to show Densha Single's singlesingle power!

349
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,757
Strategist, do you have a plan?

350
00:18:00,757 --> 00:18:02,678
Of course! Tomorrow is Sunday!

351
00:18:02,678 --> 00:18:05,715
High probability that dejected Densha will go to Akiba

352
00:18:05,715 --> 00:18:07,996
How about Undercover Akiba project?

353
00:18:07,996 --> 00:18:11,560
Densha told me he lives on the middle of the street

354
00:18:11,561 --> 00:18:12,885
I will be the announcer at the station!

355
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:11,445
I will wait at the station!

356
00:18:12,885 --> 00:18:15,682
I will do a live street performance in Akiba

357
00:18:15,682 --> 00:18:18,411
I will shout Densha in the middle of Akiba

358
00:18:18,411 --> 00:18:20,421
I will call him 3000 feet above the ground!

359
00:18:20,421 --> 00:18:22,676
I will write his story and publish it!

360
00:18:22,676 --> 00:18:24,256
I will also call for people at Akiba

361
00:18:24,256 --> 00:18:26,480
I will buy the whole Akiba to find him

362
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,305
I am going to install traps on other forums to lure him

00:39:45,427 --> 00:39:46,704
Tell her everything!

681
00:39:46,704 --> 00:39:48,563
I will pick up Densha's bones

682

Even if things don't go well with Hermes-san

683
00:39:50,232 --> 00:39:52,157
You won't be single anymore

684

You are glowing bright! Densha!

685

I will wait for you at the last stop!

The outcome doesn't matter as much

687

It is enough for us that you are confessing!

688
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,495
Should I make a shelter just in case?

It's been long

692
00:40:07,683 --> 00:40:10,182
I already miss the days being happy and sad with Densha

If you want, I can give you my useless energy!

695
00:40:14,667 --> 00:40:17,492
I am already crying...

696

I won't cry yet!

I will cry loudly when he comes back!

Densha, we are not only connected through the net

699

We are also connected in our hearts

704
00:40:44,365 --> 00:40:46,824
Seemed like a dream... or reality

With inexpressible feelings

706
00:40:49,022 --> 00:40:53,059
I am actually more worried

I will do all I can

709

Maybe today is

710
00:41:02,591 --> 00:41:07,544
A critical turning point in my life

711
00:41:10,516 --> 00:41:14,926
I will escape from the dark life I was living in until now!

712
00:41:16,257 --> 00:41:17,519
And...

713

Everyone's supporting will power
