1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:02,471
Yamada-san?

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:05,686
This is my friend, Sawazaki Kaho.

3
00:00:05,686 --> 00:00:07,103
Pleased to meet you.

4
00:00:07,103 --> 00:00:08,679
Pleased to meet you too.

5
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:11,999
Haven't we met before?

6
00:00:11,999 --> 00:00:14,184
Hm? Really?

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:26,775
Umm-

8
00:00:26,775 --> 00:00:27,966
I'm just kidding.

9
00:00:28,491 --> 00:00:30,657
You're probably the type who always says yes.  Right?

10
00:00:30,803 --> 00:00:32,711
Oh, you were just joking.

11
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:34,860
The world isn't that small.

12
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:36,302
Let's go.

13
00:00:39,764 --> 00:00:41,252
Yamada-san?

14
00:00:41,747 --> 00:00:43,203
Let's go.

15
00:00:43,273 --> 00:00:44,958
Of course.

16
00:00:55,527 --> 00:00:58,112
Hasn't it been a while since we've had to reserve a place to eat?

17
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:02,432
I thought I'd copy what Yamada-san did last time.

18
00:01:02,432 --> 00:01:03,887
Well, well.  You two seem to be getting along.

19
00:01:03,887 --> 00:01:06,510
It isn't like that.

20
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,528
Yamada-san, I've heard you surf?

21
00:01:17,512 --> 00:01:18,301
Hm?

22
00:01:18,698 --> 00:01:20,048
You don't look the type.

23
00:01:20,048 --> 00:01:21,731
Kaho, that's rude.

24
00:01:22,233 --> 00:01:22,960
Actually-

25
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,901
So where do you surf?

26
00:01:25,633 --> 00:01:27,920
Around here, it'd be Chiba or Shonan...

27
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,305
Then I guess in Chiba.

28
00:01:28,305 --> 00:01:29,129
Then?

29
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:30,009
No, no.  It's definitely Chiba

30
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:33,024
Well if it's Chiba, it could be at Onjuku, Katsuura, Ichinomiya...

31
00:01:33,024 --> 00:01:33,920
It's at Utsunomiya.

32
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,227
What, where?

33
00:01:35,792 --> 00:01:37,624
At Uw&*^@#a.

34
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,193
Oh, Ichinomiya.

35
00:01:44,193 --> 00:01:45,401
Uh, right.

36
00:01:45,401 --> 00:01:48,272
If it's Ichinomiya, then I have a friend who surfs there.

37
00:01:48,272 --> 00:01:49,651
You might have met.

38
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:57,530
Umm- I need use the washroom.

39
00:01:57,729 --> 00:01:59,257
Do you know where it is?

40
00:01:59,257 --> 00:02:00,201
Um, no.

41
00:02:00,201 --> 00:02:04,666
If you leave this store and go straight,
there'll be a set of stairs on your right.

42
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:06,505
Head downstairs, go left and you'll come an elevator.

43
00:02:06,505 --> 00:02:09,018
Get on that and go to the 6th floor.

44
00:02:09,018 --> 00:02:10,601
Once you get off, there will be a restaurant there.

45
00:02:10,601 --> 00:02:12,537
The washroom is located to your right.

46
00:02:12,537 --> 00:02:13,543
Thank you.

47
00:02:23,522 --> 00:02:25,530
It's awfully far, isn't it?

48
00:02:45,236 --> 00:02:46,455
This is good.

49
00:02:50,308 --> 00:02:53,006
I finally made it.

50
00:03:04,206 --> 00:03:05,263
Really?

51
00:03:08,078 --> 00:03:09,383
Thank you.  Thank you so much.

52
00:03:09,383 --> 00:03:12,502
Not at all.  You're very welcome.

53
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,327
This is good too.

54
00:03:28,196 --> 00:03:29,899
Thank you.

55
00:03:29,899 --> 00:03:31,907
You came back the same way?

56
00:03:31,907 --> 00:03:33,690
Well yes.

57
00:03:34,843 --> 00:03:37,596
You're really an innocent aren't you?

58
00:03:37,596 --> 00:03:40,988
I sometimes might get told that.

59
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:49,368
What do you want to do now?

60
00:03:49,368 --> 00:03:51,839
I guess one of us can leave now.

61
00:03:53,289 --> 00:03:56,570
Yamada-san, I'm sure it's been uncomfortable for you.

62
00:03:56,865 --> 00:03:58,845
Not at all.

63
00:04:00,385 --> 00:04:02,410
I'm sorry if it seemed that way.

64
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,615
Don't worry about it.

65
00:04:05,843 --> 00:04:09,930
With your permission then...

66
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,290
Saori, let's go then.

67
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,225
Good night.

68
00:04:19,153 --> 00:04:21,922
I'm sorry it couldn't have been a more quiet evening.

69
00:04:21,922 --> 00:04:24,186
No, no.  I enjoyed it.

70
00:04:24,186 --> 00:04:25,740
That was good.

71
00:04:25,741 --> 00:04:28,223
I'll call you then.

72
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,451
I'll be waiting for it.

73
00:04:32,003 --> 00:04:33,683
Well, good night.

74
00:04:34,586 --> 00:04:36,862
Good night.

75
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:05,058

88
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,927
So then I returned home on my own.

89
00:06:12,927 --> 00:06:15,637
And that's how it went.

90
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,831
I dunno.

91
00:06:21,068 --> 00:06:23,512
I think you did pretty good.

92
00:06:23,512 --> 00:06:24,012
B.

93
00:06:24,408 --> 00:06:27,568
I wonder what her friend really thought about you.

94
00:06:27,942 --> 00:06:29,039
really thought

95
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,353
He's basically just a boring guy.

96
00:06:31,353 --> 00:06:33,400
Even though you were laughing that much?

97
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,335
Out of courtesy.

98
00:06:35,335 --> 00:06:36,409
Is that what it was.

99
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:38,889
Just to make things clear, I'd say he was medium poor.

100
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:42,312
She was laughing a fair bit, so I'd say I made a good impression.

101
00:06:42,312 --> 00:06:44,170
I dunno.

102
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:47,496
What did the friend think about you and Hermes?

103
00:06:47,496 --> 00:06:50,144
Honestly, you two have nothing in common.

104
00:06:50,144 --> 00:06:51,393
I'm telling you, it's not that type of relationship.

105
00:06:51,393 --> 00:06:53,624
And I'm saying that's he's interested in you.

106
00:06:53,624 --> 00:06:55,280
At least understand him that much.

107
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,169
There were captions right here saying, "I want you".

108
00:06:58,169 --> 00:06:59,306
Around where?

109
00:06:59,306 --> 00:07:03,281
I'm saying that's how clearly he was interested in you.

110
00:07:03,281 --> 00:07:06,673
I'm sure she thought I'd make a good friend.

111
00:07:06,673 --> 00:07:09,721
She was saying "you two seem to be getting along."

112
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:13,265
I dunno.

113
00:07:13,265 --> 00:07:17,704
All that's left is whether she has a boyfriend or someone she likes.

114
00:07:19,674 --> 00:07:23,203
You there, are you living here?

115
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,397
Yes.

116
00:07:27,515 --> 00:07:29,929
You really do need to know if she has a boyfriend or not.

117
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:33,233
Keep trying to make a good impression on her.

118
00:07:33,233 --> 00:07:36,858
Call her up again and show her you care.

119
00:07:36,858 --> 00:07:39,695
I'm a girl, but why don't you trade e-mail addresses?

120
00:07:39,772 --> 00:07:43,096
You'll be able to communicate with her more readily.

121
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:44,783
How about...

122
00:07:44,783 --> 00:07:46,607
"Thank you for today-"

123
00:07:46,607 --> 00:07:48,215
"I'll choose the next store, ok?"

124
00:07:48,215 --> 00:07:51,751
"To make it easier to get in touch,
why don't we try e-mailing each other?"

125
00:07:51,751 --> 00:07:54,819
"Let's exchange e-mail addresses."

126
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:56,876
How about it?

127
00:08:00,227 --> 00:08:03,121
Her e-mail address...

128
00:08:03,865 --> 00:08:07,495
Isn't he just a pet to you?

129
00:08:07,495 --> 00:08:10,490
Pets can't heal a broken heart you know.

130
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,985
Yamada-san is-

131
00:08:11,985 --> 00:08:15,354
Hanging around him isn't going to fix what happened with Sena.

132
00:08:15,354 --> 00:08:19,146
I know you can't date anymore because of Seno.

133
00:08:19,146 --> 00:08:21,378
And I know I'm partially to blame for introducing him to you-

134
00:08:21,378 --> 00:08:23,123
Wait a minute.

135
00:08:23,123 --> 00:08:24,402
It's not your fault.

136
00:08:24,402 --> 00:08:28,251
But it's his fault that your heart's still in pieces.

137
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:43,805
It's also my fault for not noticing after all this time.

138
00:08:43,805 --> 00:08:47,348
There's nothing to gain by blaming you.

139
00:09:06,795 --> 00:09:09,588
Take care.

140
00:10:02,633 --> 00:10:04,186
You know,

141
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:07,825
I think there are a lot of people who wouldn't
think much about a lie like that.

142
00:10:07,825 --> 00:10:12,273
I'm probably not strong enough to handle dating.

143
00:10:14,873 --> 00:10:17,541
That's the type of thinking I hate.

144
00:10:20,228 --> 00:10:24,335
Hiding won't fix anything.

145
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,092
You've got to break out of that shell, and look forward.

146
00:10:29,266 --> 00:10:30,784
Kaho.

147
00:10:31,994 --> 00:10:35,601
It's what Friend A might say.

148
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:39,397
All right, let's go to the next store!

149
00:10:57,815 --> 00:10:58,815
Yamada Tsuyoshi

150
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,546
Hello?

151
00:11:08,424 --> 00:11:09,775
I'm sorry for calling so late.

152
00:11:09,775 --> 00:11:13,853
I'm glad you called.  I was in a mood to talk to someone.

153
00:11:14,295 --> 00:11:16,202
That was good.

154
00:11:16,568 --> 00:11:18,271
Um...

155
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:22,702
Thank you for today.

156
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:26,897
No, no.  Thank YOU.

157
00:11:26,897 --> 00:11:29,409
I'll decide on the next store, then.

158
00:11:29,409 --> 00:11:30,840
Ok.

159
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,839
And...

160
00:11:34,249 --> 00:11:37,481
Hiding won't fix anything.

161
00:11:37,481 --> 00:11:40,300
Break out of that shell and look forward.

162
00:11:41,177 --> 00:11:44,478
You have to take me to the ocean some day.

163
00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:47,481
Argh..umm...that would...

164
00:11:47,481 --> 00:11:49,313
I'm looking forward to it.

165
00:11:49,313 --> 00:11:50,789
Ok.

166
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,496
Uh..um.

167
00:12:01,145 --> 00:12:02,953
Talking like this is great but...

168
00:12:02,953 --> 00:12:04,936
if it's not a problem,

169
00:12:04,936 --> 00:12:11,387
the thing is, cell phones can be used for other than talking and...

170
00:12:13,911 --> 00:12:18,457
I got her email address!!

171
00:12:18,609 --> 00:12:19,859
Densha!

172
00:12:27,225 --> 00:12:28,225
New e-mail
Aoyama-san

173
00:12:30,856 --> 00:12:33,951
I decided to e-mail you right away.

174
00:12:39,753 --> 00:12:42,153
I decided to e-mail you right away.

175
00:12:42,153 --> 00:12:44,345
An e-mail came!!

176
00:12:44,345 --> 00:12:46,138
Densha!

177
00:12:50,657 --> 00:12:54,037
I'm looking forward to seeing you surf.

178
00:12:56,186 --> 00:12:58,580
Give us the details.

179
00:13:00,562 --> 00:13:03,026
I talked about this before,

180
00:13:03,026 --> 00:13:04,883
but due to a small error in communication,

181
00:13:04,883 --> 00:13:07,325
my hobby is supposed to be surfing.

182
00:13:07,482 --> 00:13:08,999
Are you going to be ok?

183
00:13:09,074 --> 00:13:10,609
Shouldn't you deny this?

184
00:13:10,643 --> 00:13:12,593
Surfing is... impossible.

185
00:13:12,765 --> 00:13:15,283
Is there really no way?  What should I do?

186
00:13:15,283 --> 00:13:17,444
You should do what you want to do.

187
00:13:19,452 --> 00:13:21,850
I'll look up some hints you can learn fast.

188
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,004
It's impossible for an Otaku.

189
00:13:23,004 --> 00:13:26,710
You'll be fine.  Even I'm going to be getting my driving license soon.

190
00:13:26,745 --> 00:13:28,539
With your enthusiasm, there's nothing you can't do.

191
00:13:28,539 --> 00:13:30,995
If it's just getting on a board and standing, I think you can do it.

192
00:13:30,995 --> 00:13:32,827
All you have to do is look like you can surf.

193
00:13:32,827 --> 00:13:34,909
You haven't decided on a date yet, so I'd say go for it.

194
00:13:34,909 --> 00:13:39,841
Let's all find surfing tips for Densha and advise him.

195
00:13:43,324 --> 00:13:45,084
Thanks, all of you.

196
00:13:45,084 --> 00:13:47,329
I'll try it.

197
00:13:52,436 --> 00:14:01,038
I   am   also   looking   forward   to   it.

198
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:12,943
Here we go!

199
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:30,173
Keep your weight low.   Master your ups and downs.

200
00:14:30,885 --> 00:14:36,632
Ups  and  Down...

201
00:14:39,853 --> 00:14:41,604
Don't look at your feet.

202
00:14:41,604 --> 00:14:44,612
You should always be facing where you want to go.

203
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,805
Aloha~

204
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:52,973
You've got the report properly written.

205
00:14:52,973 --> 00:14:54,423
What are you shaking for?

206
00:14:54,423 --> 00:14:56,070
No reason.

207
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,815
We've just recieved a renewal on the Hikari Sangyou contract.

208
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:02,705
You're also coming to dinner with us ok?
You did good.

209
00:15:04,382 --> 00:15:07,822
The key point at a dinner with a client is "heart to heart".

210
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,312
Equality between "you and me".

211
00:15:13,678 --> 00:15:15,477
I'm here to make a delivery.

212
00:15:17,742 --> 00:15:19,830
... to better yourself.  Synthesize and...

213
00:15:38,768 --> 00:15:41,484
When you're paddling, keep your back arched.

214
00:15:41,484 --> 00:15:45,671
An early take off gives you time to get your balance.

215
00:15:53,581 --> 00:15:58,342
Hand movements are also important in maintaining balance.

216
00:15:57,842 --> 00:15:59,356
All right.

217
00:16:01,716 --> 00:16:07,602
Wilder.  More Wild.

218
00:16:08,603 --> 00:16:10,449
More, more, more!!

219
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:14,103
What are you practicing?

220
00:16:14,103 --> 00:16:16,080
I'm not.

221
00:16:19,495 --> 00:16:21,319
What, surfing?

222
00:16:21,792 --> 00:16:23,666
You don't look the type.

223
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,468
So what kind of board are you using?

224
00:16:26,468 --> 00:16:27,862
A long.

225
00:16:28,168 --> 00:16:31,077
Yeah, that'll be easier for a beginner.

226
00:16:31,111 --> 00:16:33,580
Oikawa-san, you've surfed before?

227
00:16:34,736 --> 00:16:37,889
Back when I was in Hawaii, I was pretty famous.

228
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:39,540
Really?

229
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,332
I was good.

230
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:47,721
If there's an expert around you, study them closely and learn.

231
00:16:55,297 --> 00:16:56,169
What is it?

232
00:16:56,169 --> 00:16:59,610
Study them closely and learn.

233
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,146
What?

234
00:17:03,642 --> 00:17:06,237
Aoyama-kun, I need to see you for a minute.

235
00:17:10,394 --> 00:17:12,065
Hey, how was it yesterday?

236
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:14,538
You mean that Yamada Tsuyoshi?

237
00:17:14,931 --> 00:17:16,475
I don't know what you were thinking,

238
00:17:16,475 --> 00:17:18,931
but he's totally NG.

239
00:17:18,931 --> 00:17:20,787
I think even Saori will see him anymore.

240
00:17:20,787 --> 00:17:23,139
Really?  What was NG about him?

241
00:17:23,139 --> 00:17:24,509
I dunno...

242
00:17:24,691 --> 00:17:27,571
He's honest, but 120% the type who'll end as a friend.

243
00:17:27,571 --> 00:17:28,507
He's gentle, but-

244
00:17:28,507 --> 00:17:30,203
He lacks presence?

245
00:17:30,203 --> 00:17:31,301
He's faithful-

246
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:32,268
but a wash out.

247
00:17:32,268 --> 00:17:33,035
Not bad looking,

248
00:17:33,035 --> 00:17:35,596
but totally forgettable?

249
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,427
Forget it.

250
00:17:36,427 --> 00:17:37,731
Meeting's over.

251
00:17:42,268 --> 00:17:44,213
I have to mail Yamada-san.

I think that company's about finished.

It's just too early.

257
00:17:56,373 --> 00:17:58,404
Yeah, I think I may have gone too far.

What are you talking about?

When to take her to see my surfing.

261
00:18:06,438 --> 00:18:08,405
You can surf?

262
00:18:08,405 --> 00:18:09,822
Not really.  Technically,

263
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,693
I'll be able to surf sometime soon.

264
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:14,628

I'm in serious trouble here.

267
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:21,261
Serious trouble?

268
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:22,132
Yeah.

269
00:18:22,931 --> 00:18:24,753
I slept with the Vice President

270
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,413

don't send stuff like that.

Here's your drink.

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,279
It was specially made using a mix of vegetables.

286
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:20,304
It looks great.

You came here for a reason didn't you?

288
00:19:27,673 --> 00:19:29,088
I wouldn't have come if I didn't.

289
00:19:29,088 --> 00:19:30,919
If it's the owner, he's gone to buy supplies.

290
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,544
So Kazuya-san isn't here.

291

That was why you came?

00:33:12,978 --> 00:33:15,346
You rotten bastard.

500
00:33:15,346 --> 00:33:18,116
Did you think Saori could ever like you?

501
00:33:18,665 --> 00:33:22,658
You've got a lot of nerve making my cute little sister cry.

502
00:33:22,658 --> 00:33:24,129
One of these days

503
00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:27,456
I'm coming around to beat you to a pulp
and sink you into Tokyo bay.

504
00:33:28,426 --> 00:33:29,678
Tell him.

505
00:33:32,674 --> 00:33:34,369
I hate you, you pig!

506
00:33:35,098 --> 00:33:37,427
I never want to see your face.

507
00:33:38,617 --> 00:33:40,053
You liar!

508
00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:42,122
You big ugly liar!

509
00:33:42,122 --> 00:33:45,899
Yeah, you idiot, you silly liar!

510
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:48,016
I hate your guts!

511
00:34:02,401 --> 00:34:04,065
You're really amazing.

512
00:34:06,653 --> 00:34:09,257
I don't think anyone would have imagined it.

513
00:34:12,382 --> 00:34:16,134
That you wouldn't even stand once.

514
00:34:23,232 --> 00:34:24,968
I did all I could.

515
00:34:24,968 --> 00:34:33,450
But I'm still not sure I should try it, knowing I'm going to fail.

516
00:34:33,478 --> 00:34:36,233
I think Hermes will understand.

517
00:34:41,428 --> 00:34:44,358
I think it takes courage to admit your mistakes.

518
00:34:44,358 --> 00:34:47,773
If it doesn't work out, you can cry then.

519
00:35:00,213 --> 00:35:04,762
A long time ago, I lied to a girl and hurt her.

520
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:08,798
In doing so, I lost everything.

521
00:35:08,798 --> 00:35:13,047
It was only afterwards that I realized how much she meant to me.

522
00:35:13,047 --> 00:35:15,538
I'm regret it now.

523
00:35:16,055 --> 00:35:20,256
And that's why I don't want you to make the same mistake.

524
00:35:21,383 --> 00:35:23,903
It doesn't matter if you can't surf.

525
00:35:23,903 --> 00:35:27,584
Just realize that you lied.

526
00:35:31,615 --> 00:35:33,723
What's important

527
00:35:34,143 --> 00:35:39,309
is that you decide what to do while thinking about Hermes-san.

528
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:43,056
I'm sorry for the long reply.

529
00:36:20,189 --> 00:36:22,141
Good morning.

530
00:36:24,096 --> 00:36:25,894
Good morning.

531
00:36:34,533 --> 00:36:37,021
I made lunch.

532
00:36:38,317 --> 00:36:40,013
I see.

533
00:36:40,013 --> 00:36:41,619
Thank you.

534
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:00,980
Be careful.

535
00:37:03,398 --> 00:37:04,812
I will.

536
00:37:12,206 --> 00:37:14,947
Don't try anything too dangerous.

537
00:37:17,344 --> 00:37:18,928
Ok.

538
00:37:29,983 --> 00:37:31,796
A lie...

539
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,844
into reality.

540
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:52,305
You ended up lying to Hermes-san.

541
00:37:52,305 --> 00:37:54,633
It's true that your honesty was your greatest appeal.

542
00:37:54,633 --> 00:37:57,200
Lying could be a fatal error.

543
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,620
If you don't do anything, it'll all end with this lie.

544
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:15,191
This is an annoucement.

545
00:38:15,191 --> 00:38:18,143
Due to the storm, there's a chance of lightning.

546
00:38:18,143 --> 00:38:20,103
Please seek shelter in a safe area.

547
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:21,424
Yamada-san.

548
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:23,024
It's dangerous.

549
00:38:26,279 --> 00:38:28,606
It's no good in this weather.

550
00:38:29,799 --> 00:38:32,767
Please hurry back.

551
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:36,535
It's unfortunate-

552
00:38:36,535 --> 00:38:38,181
It's not.

553
00:38:42,008 --> 00:38:44,105
It's not...

554
00:38:54,033 --> 00:38:56,769
It's not unfortunate at all.

555
00:39:00,934 --> 00:39:04,321
I'm actually relieved.

556
00:39:24,554 --> 00:39:27,018
What's important

557
00:39:27,018 --> 00:39:32,333
is that you decide what to do while thinking about Hermes-san.

558
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,707
I'm sorry.

559
00:39:45,707 --> 00:39:47,095
I...

560
00:39:47,139 --> 00:39:48,838
can't surf.

561
00:39:52,275 --> 00:39:53,269
I...

562
00:39:53,897 --> 00:39:57,260
lied to you.

563
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,875
Lied?

564
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:04,209
The first time we had dinner,

565
00:40:04,939 --> 00:40:10,030
I couldn't tell you that net surfing was
another name for using the internet.

566
00:40:12,908 --> 00:40:16,923
I'm so sorry for lying to you.

567
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:46,777
So you went out of your way and bought a surfboard and a wetsuit?

568
00:40:59,343 --> 00:41:02,890
You've hurt yourself in so many places.

569
00:41:04,843 --> 00:41:12,763
For every bruise on your body I've caused you worry.

570
00:41:19,116 --> 00:41:22,595
I'm also sorry.

571
00:41:25,595 --> 00:41:29,566
If I hadn't misheard you...

572
00:41:33,693 --> 00:41:36,307
That's why...

573
00:41:36,307 --> 00:41:46,066
it's not a lie.

574
00:42:11,835 --> 00:42:13,387
...and that's how it went.

575
00:42:13,387 --> 00:42:17,852
Thank you as always.

576
00:42:17,852 --> 00:42:20,398
Densha~

577
00:43:20,554 --> 00:43:22,424
Are you hungry?

578
00:43:25,834 --> 00:43:27,656
Here.

579
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:29,907
Thank you.

580
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:53,232
(-----Yes----)
(-----Yes-----)     (-----Yes-----)

581
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:02,084
This is our new list of employees.

582
00:44:02,084 --> 00:44:02,996
Thank you.

583
00:44:02,996 --> 00:44:04,505
You're welcome.

584
00:44:06,492 --> 00:44:08,539
This is Tanaka's profile here.

585
00:44:08,645 --> 00:44:10,020
He's relatively new...

586
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:14,486
When to take her to see my surfing.

587
00:44:18,885 --> 00:44:19,657

588
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,294

00:44:33,086 --> 00:44:35,229
Let me mail her right back.

592
