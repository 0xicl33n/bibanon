When I told her I haven't had a chance to use the cups,
she told me she'd make tea.

50
00:02:05,185 --> 00:02:07,191
And so she asked me,

"So why don't you come over tomorrow?"

Saori's having a hard time with relationships
because of her old boyfriend.

That's why I'm trying to find her a suitable guy.

00:09:40,991 --> 00:09:42,630
Yes?

165
00:09:43,544 --> 00:09:44,856
Hi, it's Yamada.

166
00:09:44,856 --> 00:09:47,392
I j, jjjjust got here.

167
00:09:47,392 --> 00:09:49,391
I'll be right there.

168
00:09:49,391 --> 00:09:51,454
Ok.

00:11:35,634 --> 00:11:37,714
W, what's this called?

186
00:11:37,714 --> 00:11:39,721
A patio.

187
00:11:39,721 --> 00:11:40,858
P, patio?

188
00:11:40,858 --> 00:11:43,570
I'll bring tea right away.  Why don't you have a seat?

189
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,330
Ok, thank you.

190
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,201
A recessed floor...

191
00:12:20,265 --> 00:12:21,800
What happened?

192
00:12:22,135 --> 00:12:24,542
It's an awfully cute diggie you have.

193
00:12:24,999 --> 00:12:26,781
That's amazing.

194
00:12:26,781 --> 00:12:29,350
I stopped using it since it broke.

195
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:32,278
Your hard disk wasn't broken so I was able to fix it.

196
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:35,493
You should do regular maintenance to keep it working.

197
00:12:35,493 --> 00:12:38,118
I'll check to see if you can connect to the internet properly.

198
00:12:38,118 --> 00:12:41,382
I'm sorry, and you've only just got here.

199
00:12:41,382 --> 00:12:43,750
I'm boiling the water now.

200
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:51,937
These are Hermes cups.

201
00:12:55,182 --> 00:12:59,670
They're really just the way I sent them.

202
00:13:03,672 --> 00:13:06,847
I'll borrow these then.

203
00:13:12,635 --> 00:13:20,499
Since we..  When we met...

204
00:13:29,023 --> 00:13:30,241
A Channel

205
00:13:30,241 --> 00:13:34,625
I was actually thinking of replacing it.

206
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:37,732
Really?

207
00:13:37,732 --> 00:13:40,217
I'm at Herman-san's house right now.

208
00:13:40,217 --> 00:13:43,978
What? Y, you're not looking at it with Hermes are you?

209
00:13:43,978 --> 00:13:45,834
No, I'm hiding it.

210
00:13:45,834 --> 00:13:49,890
Live from Hermes-san's house!! Oh no, not again.

211
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:53,138
Idiot!  What if she catches you?

212
00:13:53,138 --> 00:13:55,411
Th, there's a cute doggie too.

213
00:13:55,411 --> 00:13:57,386
Shut it down now!!  What do you think you're doing?

214
00:13:57,386 --> 00:13:59,914
But I forgot what my lines were.

215
00:13:59,914 --> 00:14:01,570
Is English tea ok?

216
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,244
Y, yes.

217
00:14:03,244 --> 00:14:05,847
Please choose one of these.

218
00:14:07,907 --> 00:14:10,282
She just brought in these cans of tea.

219
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:12,731
This isn't good, it's too real.

220
00:14:12,731 --> 00:14:15,532
I guess her household drinks really expensive tea.

221
00:14:21,118 --> 00:14:22,627
It says  BE-NO-IST.

222
00:14:22,627 --> 00:14:24,164
Be no ist?

223
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:26,364
Don't you read it be nwa?

224
00:14:26,364 --> 00:14:30,603
Benoist. Established in the 19th century,
they provide the finest in food and drink.

225
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:31,835
Intelligence, thanks for the info.

226
00:14:31,835 --> 00:14:34,005
They cater to the British royalty!!!!

227
00:14:34,005 --> 00:14:36,436
Benoist Tea, yay!!!

228
00:14:36,436 --> 00:14:38,392
Have you decided yet?

229
00:14:38,908 --> 00:14:40,516
I'll go with the Benoist.

230
00:14:40,516 --> 00:14:41,996
They're all Benoist.

231
00:14:41,996 --> 00:14:43,164
Huh?

232
00:14:43,164 --> 00:14:45,500
Um, I'll go with this.

233
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,405
Darjeeling?  I like it too.

234
00:14:48,405 --> 00:14:50,493
Right.

235
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:57,446
Densha!!  Don't worry about what you're going to say!!

236
00:14:57,446 --> 00:15:00,262
Just tell you have you feel!!  Tell her!!!

237
00:15:00,517 --> 00:15:02,709
How about the timing?

238
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:04,857
Tell her you like her!!

239
00:15:05,869 --> 00:15:08,100
Is everything ok?

240
00:15:08,495 --> 00:15:11,078
Uh.. actually-

241
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:14,166
How were the muffins?

242
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,886
Oh, they were great.  I can barely stop eating.

243
00:15:16,886 --> 00:15:18,831
I'm glad you liked them.

244
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:28,878
Hurry up and tell her!

245
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:39,014
U, u, u, u, uh...

246
00:15:39,014 --> 00:15:43,136
It's such a nice day out.  We should go somewhere.

247
00:15:44,455 --> 00:15:45,703
Once you leave,

248
00:15:45,703 --> 00:15:47,383
you're out!

249
00:15:49,488 --> 00:15:52,943
You won't be able to tell her where there's people around.

250
00:15:52,943 --> 00:15:55,288
Guard the house!

251
00:15:57,496 --> 00:16:01,888
Don't leave the house 'til you tell her!!

252
00:16:01,888 --> 00:16:05,416
Uh.. I brought a dvd with me.  The Matrix?

253
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:08,713
Oh, the one we were talking about.

254
00:16:10,013 --> 00:16:11,694
Huh?

255
00:16:11,694 --> 00:16:14,358
Doggies?  Why?

256
00:16:14,358 --> 00:16:17,807
Oh, Quill.  I wanted to watch it too.

257
00:16:17,807 --> 00:16:19,135
Really?

258
00:16:19,135 --> 00:16:20,535
Let's watch it then.

259
00:16:20,535 --> 00:16:23,573
Ok.

260
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:27,004
So...

261
00:16:27,979 --> 00:16:31,391
The button on the far left, that's for the power.

262
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:32,663
This one?

263
00:16:32,663 --> 00:16:33,735
Yes.

264
00:16:33,735 --> 00:16:36,712
I'm really bad at using these.

265
00:16:36,712 --> 00:16:39,800
I'm sorry.

266
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,760
Hurry up and tell her.

267
00:17:11,336 --> 00:17:14,136
I wonder what he's doing right now.

268
00:17:14,136 --> 00:17:16,124
Benoist tea...

269
00:17:17,057 --> 00:17:19,798
I need a girl too.

270
00:17:33,957 --> 00:17:35,966
Hurry up and tell her!!

271
00:17:35,966 --> 00:17:39,774
Densha!! Densha!! Densha!! Say it!!!

272
00:17:39,774 --> 00:17:41,982
Tell her already!!!

273
00:17:41,982 --> 00:17:45,014
The next stop is lover's lane, lover's lane.

274
00:17:45,014 --> 00:17:46,207
Densha-san...

275
00:17:46,207 --> 00:17:47,966
It's time to lay your own tracks.

276
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:51,021
You can do it Densha, tell her!!!

277
00:17:51,021 --> 00:17:54,213
Do it I tell ya!!!!

278
00:17:54,213 --> 00:17:56,664
Hurry up and tell her!!

279
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,194
I'm sorry.

280
00:18:04,037 --> 00:18:05,981
Uh... I..

281
00:18:08,572 --> 00:18:11,156
So...you didn't end up telling her?

282
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:12,589
I'm sorry.

283
00:18:12,589 --> 00:18:16,469
I just couldn't.  I don't have the courage to say "I like you".

284
00:18:16,469 --> 00:18:18,028
You can't keep saying that forever!!

285
00:18:18,028 --> 00:18:19,181
You like her don't you?

286
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:22,333
You were invited to her house and you didn't do anything?
You loser!!

287
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,279
Don't tell us you weren't able to get a second date?

288
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:26,918
Actually that's all set up.

289
00:18:26,918 --> 00:18:28,462
A musical?

290
00:18:28,462 --> 00:18:29,822
You don't like them?

291
00:18:29,822 --> 00:18:30,726
No,

292
00:18:30,726 --> 00:18:32,286
I...think I like them.

293
00:18:32,286 --> 00:18:35,302
If you're free, do you want to go this Saturday?

294
00:18:35,302 --> 00:18:37,926
Of course.  I'd love to.

295
00:18:37,926 --> 00:18:39,886
What, she asked you?

296
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:41,190
Doesn't that mean she likes you too?

297
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:43,766
Yeah, she's definitely acting differently lately.

298
00:18:43,766 --> 00:18:46,359
You're invited to her house, then asked on a date.

299
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:49,390
All things I've never experienced, and all in one day!!
You punk!

300
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,814
Well, Densha won't be needing our advice anymore.

301
00:18:51,814 --> 00:18:54,847
That's right.  Densha's last mission is only to

302
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,941
tell her how he feels.

303
00:18:56,941 --> 00:18:58,861
But if I do tell her, and she rejects me,

304
00:18:58,861 --> 00:19:00,533
then we'll no longer be as close.

305
00:19:00,533 --> 00:19:03,069
And you call yourself a man?!!  Tell her!!

306
00:19:03,069 --> 00:19:05,038
It's going to be ok.

307
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:06,822
Would she invite you over otherwise?

308
00:19:06,822 --> 00:19:09,223
Generally speaking, there should be no problem.

309
00:19:09,223 --> 00:19:11,078
No need for hesitation.

310
00:19:11,078 --> 00:19:14,150
But we still haven't found out if she has a boyfriend.

311
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,002
Think rationally about the situation.

312
00:19:16,002 --> 00:19:18,343
What gives you any hint there's anything to worry about?

313
00:19:18,343 --> 00:19:20,006
So what if she has a boyfriend.

314
00:19:20,006 --> 00:19:21,834
Tell her now, tell her right now.

315
00:19:21,834 --> 00:19:24,574
The timing's important.  Don't pass up this chance.

316
00:19:24,574 --> 00:19:26,295
I'm really scared.  [dispair]

317
00:19:26,295 --> 00:19:28,303
I'm sorry I'm such a coward.

318
00:19:28,303 --> 00:19:30,623
Are you planning on turning away
from a battle you know you can win?

319
00:19:30,623 --> 00:19:33,023
Think about Hermes' feelings too.

320
00:19:33,023 --> 00:19:34,455
You're telling her on the next date!

321
00:19:34,455 --> 00:19:36,856
Work up the courage and go for it!

322
00:19:36,856 --> 00:19:39,744
If you've come this far, you're not going to be rejected.

323
00:19:39,744 --> 00:19:42,465
Densha, we're all with you.

324
00:19:42,465 --> 00:19:45,488
Work up the courage and pass on to the next Stage!

325
00:19:45,488 --> 00:19:48,374
The next stage.

326
00:19:48,374 --> 00:19:49,847
Hey!

327
00:19:49,847 --> 00:19:52,039
There's a wierd call for you.

328
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:54,090
A wierd call?

329
00:19:55,002 --> 00:19:55,953
Hello?

330
00:19:55,953 --> 00:19:59,929
Your sister's voice is as cute as always.

331
00:20:01,017 --> 00:20:02,890
Did a blue envelope get there?

332
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:06,076
A blue envelope?

333
00:20:11,329 --> 00:20:12,177
Yeah, I have it here.

334
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:15,401
Does the address label have a color?

335
00:20:15,401 --> 00:20:17,202
Yes, it's blue.

336
00:20:17,202 --> 00:20:21,809
No way!  Yamada-shi was chosen!

337
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:23,049
I was chosen?

338
00:20:23,049 --> 00:20:26,832
That envelope is the entry ticket to Comicke.

339
00:20:26,832 --> 00:20:30,146
The white label is NG, the blue means you won.

340
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:32,552
So the other members of your household don't get too excited,

341
00:20:32,552 --> 00:20:36,297
the envelope was made to look like normal mail.*

342
00:20:36,297 --> 00:20:37,378
So then Yamada-shi,

343
00:20:37,378 --> 00:20:38,984
See you there!

344
00:20:38,984 --> 00:20:40,170
All right.

345
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:43,649
Just so you know, they need to confirm the bearer's identity

346
00:20:43,649 --> 00:20:45,194
so you have to come in person.

347
00:20:45,194 --> 00:20:46,201
It'll only take a minute,

348
00:20:46,201 --> 00:20:47,361
so you gotta come out.

349
00:20:47,361 --> 00:20:48,737
Got it.

350
00:20:48,737 --> 00:20:49,689
So when is it?

351
00:20:49,689 --> 00:20:50,832
Saturday.

352
00:20:51,282 --> 00:20:52,464
It's going to be great!

353
00:20:52,464 --> 00:20:54,008
Saturday I have to-

354
00:20:54,008 --> 00:20:56,273
Hello?! Hello?!

355
00:21:05,216 --> 00:21:08,202
What am I going to do?

356
00:21:14,577 --> 00:21:17,217
Comike, the highlight of the sumer and the date with Hermes.

357
00:21:17,217 --> 00:21:18,801
Which should I choose?

358
00:21:18,801 --> 00:21:20,666
Hey Densha,

359
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:23,202
Are you deliberately provoking me?

360
00:21:23,202 --> 00:21:25,170
Of course it's the date!!

361
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,529
Of course I'd normally go to the date,

362
00:21:27,529 --> 00:21:30,787
but this time there's a reason why I have to go.

363
00:21:30,787 --> 00:21:33,465
And it's more imporant than a date with Hermes?
A convention?

364
00:21:33,465 --> 00:21:36,612
Wait. As another Anime otaku,
you have to understand how he feels.

365
00:21:36,612 --> 00:21:38,938
I totally agree.  If you've ever went, you'd know.

366
00:21:38,938 --> 00:21:40,322
One vote for Comike!

367
00:21:40,322 --> 00:21:43,858
As someone uninterrested in fan comics,
I can't figure out what's going in Densha's mind.

368
00:21:43,858 --> 00:21:47,524
The date comes first!!
As a man, there's no other choice!!

369
00:21:47,524 --> 00:21:49,283
You accepted the date first.

370
00:21:49,283 --> 00:21:50,882
Go for the Comike!!  It only comes once a year!!

371
00:21:50,882 --> 00:21:53,555
The way you're going right now,
you can have the date later!!

372
00:21:53,555 --> 00:21:54,359
Comike!!!

373
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:55,411
Date!!!

374
00:21:55,411 --> 00:21:58,332
Either way,
this is probably going to be your last Comike right?

375
00:21:58,332 --> 00:22:01,663
That's true.
Once you start dating her, you won't be able to go.

376
00:22:01,721 --> 00:22:03,291
On the other hand,

377
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,684
you should go to say goodbye and make it your last Comike.

378
00:22:05,684 --> 00:22:06,595
My vote goes to Comike.

379
00:22:06,595 --> 00:22:07,764
My vote goes to the date.

380
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,697
Comike?

381
00:22:26,258 --> 00:22:30,531
He'd look out of place at a musical anyway,
what's that idiot thinking?

382
00:22:30,566 --> 00:22:35,364
Were you able to get hold of the tickets?
That's great, thank you.

383
00:22:35,364 --> 00:22:38,435
Yes, I'm sure it'll be fun.

384
00:22:38,435 --> 00:22:41,052
Thanks again.

385
00:22:48,612 --> 00:22:49,928
Hello?

386
00:22:50,254 --> 00:22:51,356
I'm sorry for calling so late.

387
00:22:51,356 --> 00:22:53,429
No no, it was actually great timing.

388
00:22:53,429 --> 00:22:55,884
Um... The thing is-

389
00:22:55,884 --> 00:22:57,988
I was able to get the tickets.

390
00:22:57,988 --> 00:22:59,574
And that's the thing.

391
00:22:59,574 --> 00:23:01,851
Is there a problem?

392
00:23:01,851 --> 00:23:04,865
It's about work.

393
00:23:04,865 --> 00:23:07,356
I forgot I had to go that day.

394
00:23:07,356 --> 00:23:08,701
On a Saturday?

395
00:23:08,701 --> 00:23:11,108
Yes.

396
00:23:11,108 --> 00:23:12,420
But actually,

397
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,316
work can wait.

398
00:23:14,316 --> 00:23:18,197
You've already got the tickets and all.

399
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:21,925
No, you should take care of work first.

400
00:23:21,925 --> 00:23:24,077
It's too bad,

401
00:23:24,077 --> 00:23:26,739
but we can go some other time.

402
00:23:27,082 --> 00:23:28,163
But-

403
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:32,957
Then meet me on Sunday.

404
00:23:32,957 --> 00:23:33,953
Of course.

405
00:23:33,953 --> 00:23:37,170
My PC seems to have broken again.

406
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:40,346
I'm thinking of buying a new one,

407
00:23:40,346 --> 00:23:42,866
but do you think you can choose one for me?

408
00:23:42,866 --> 00:23:43,964
Of course.

409
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,547
I'd love to.

410
00:23:45,547 --> 00:23:48,187
Afterwards we can go for something good to eat.

411
00:23:48,187 --> 00:23:51,012
Ok, it sounds great.

412
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,563
Have a good night.

413
00:23:52,563 --> 00:23:57,255
[Sunday, PC, Aoyama-san]

414
00:24:00,404 --> 00:24:03,163
Doesn't that mean you like him?

415
00:24:03,163 --> 00:24:04,042
Like?

416
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:05,682
You let him into your house right?

417
00:24:05,682 --> 00:24:07,290
Yes, but..  Like isn't-

418
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:09,235
I haven't felt that lately.

419
00:24:09,235 --> 00:24:10,642
When you like someone so much,

420
00:24:10,642 --> 00:24:12,274
and you get all giddy?

421
00:24:12,274 --> 00:24:14,762
You let them up, and you wonder

422
00:24:14,762 --> 00:24:17,171
What's going to happen now?

423
00:24:17,171 --> 00:24:21,334
Or just seeing him talking to another girl
makes you want to throttle him?

424
00:24:21,368 --> 00:24:24,803
I haven't felt that in so many years...

425
00:24:25,723 --> 00:24:27,499
Doesn't that mean you don't like him?

426
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:29,171
Pretend I'm Yamada.

427
00:24:29,171 --> 00:24:31,307
We're sitting side by side.

428
00:24:31,307 --> 00:24:33,003
Our hands touch momentarily.

429
00:24:33,003 --> 00:24:37,404
Does it cause a jolt?

430
00:24:37,404 --> 00:24:39,014
It doesn't.

431
00:24:39,014 --> 00:24:39,994
See, it's like that.

432
00:24:39,994 --> 00:24:41,620
You don't like him.

433
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,540
Normally you get excited.

434
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:46,284
And you want to hold his hand.

435
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:49,812
Love isn't something you have to think about.

436
00:24:58,373 --> 00:25:01,533
If you're going to sigh, can't you do that elsewhere?

437
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:02,340
Sorry.

438
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:05,732
It's like everyone around me is sighing lately.

439
00:25:05,732 --> 00:25:08,554
Oh, Hermes...

440
00:25:09,622 --> 00:25:11,354
What, Hermes?

441
00:25:26,663 --> 00:25:32,887
Densha.

442
00:25:32,887 --> 00:25:45,032
I'm holding on.

443
00:25:45,032 --> 00:25:47,856
Comike.

444
00:25:48,432 --> 00:25:50,608
Why is it I have to wait around for you.

445
00:25:50,608 --> 00:25:51,984
You're the one who called up suddenly.

446
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:53,584
No complaining!

447
00:25:53,584 --> 00:25:54,504
Here.

448
00:25:54,504 --> 00:25:55,064
What is it?

449
00:25:55,064 --> 00:25:56,640
It's a discount coupon.

450
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,440
See, I'm trying to save you money.

451
00:25:59,684 --> 00:26:01,322
So I'm paying?

452
00:26:01,322 --> 00:26:03,706
Well of course.

453
00:26:04,624 --> 00:26:06,497
Hold it.

454
00:26:06,497 --> 00:26:08,585
There's no other reason why I'd call you here.

455
00:26:08,585 --> 00:26:09,992
Welcome to our store.

456
00:26:09,992 --> 00:26:12,041
Here are your menus.

457
00:26:12,041 --> 00:26:13,577
Please take your time.

458
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,226
It's expensive.

459
00:26:23,435 --> 00:26:24,532
What is it?

460
00:26:24,532 --> 00:26:27,617
I can't believe you're the same species.

461
00:26:33,317 --> 00:26:36,277
What are you doing just standing there?

462
00:26:39,861 --> 00:26:43,201
He's a great looking guy isn't he?

463
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,847
What are you doing?

464
00:26:49,421 --> 00:26:52,757
What, is that girl the one you like?

465
00:26:52,757 --> 00:26:54,766
Of course not.

466
00:26:54,766 --> 00:26:57,709
So it is.  My.

467
00:26:57,709 --> 00:26:59,510
I wonder if those two are going out?

468
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,066
What?

469
00:27:05,142 --> 00:27:06,230
Who is it?

470
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,390
Do you know him?

471
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:09,566
Uh huh.

472
00:27:09,566 --> 00:27:12,247
That's the guy?

473
00:27:12,247 --> 00:27:14,814
Hmm.. He's got a pretty cute girl with him.

474
00:27:14,814 --> 00:27:16,494
Kind of prim.

475
00:27:16,494 --> 00:27:18,721
I wonder if that's his girl.

476
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,920
It could be that's what they're thinking.

477
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,143
That we're going out.

478
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:25,351
I doubt it.

479
00:27:25,351 --> 00:27:27,766
It could be we look like a couple.

480
00:27:27,766 --> 00:27:29,382
That we're beauty and the ape.

481
00:27:29,382 --> 00:27:31,368
An ape?

482
00:27:33,774 --> 00:27:34,848
Leave it to me.

483
00:27:34,848 --> 00:27:36,310
I'll ask for you.

484
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,880
Something's suspicious too.

485
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,733
What is?

486
00:27:39,911 --> 00:27:40,879
Let me ask for you.

487
00:27:40,879 --> 00:27:41,919
Wait a minute.

488
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,532
Wait.

489
00:27:44,716 --> 00:27:45,432
Could I get your number?

490
00:27:45,432 --> 00:27:47,836
Tell me your's too.

491
00:27:48,351 --> 00:27:50,498
Can you see it ok?

492
00:27:51,621 --> 00:27:56,191
I was surprised, you were suddenly there.

493
00:27:56,191 --> 00:27:59,215
So was I.

494
00:27:59,215 --> 00:28:01,143
Back there,

495
00:28:01,143 --> 00:28:04,960
I first thought she was your girlfriend.

496
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,234
I was jealous.

497
00:28:08,234 --> 00:28:10,372
What do you mean?

498
00:28:10,372 --> 00:28:12,880
I'm bad with women.

499
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,880
Really?

500
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,063
Well yeah.

501
00:28:16,063 --> 00:28:19,880
At least to me, you're very attractive.

502
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,528
Hm?

503
00:28:39,289 --> 00:28:41,344
I...

504
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:46,049
Um...

505
00:28:46,049 --> 00:28:49,281
I have something I have to tell you.

506
00:28:49,281 --> 00:28:55,293
I've wanted to tell you for a while.

507
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,234
Today we...

508
00:29:02,457 --> 00:29:05,814
met by coincidence and...

509
00:29:05,849 --> 00:29:11,529
I...I not prepared.

510
00:29:11,529 --> 00:29:16,065
Not for what I want to say.

511
00:29:16,065 --> 00:29:21,101
The next time we meet...

512
00:29:24,953 --> 00:29:28,113
I have something important to say..

513
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:32,451
at least..

514
00:29:32,451 --> 00:29:37,491
it is for me.

515
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:41,871
It's very important and...

516
00:29:45,862 --> 00:29:49,523
I need to tell you.

517
00:29:50,037 --> 00:29:54,240
To say how I feel.

518
00:29:59,252 --> 00:30:04,080
W, will you hear what I have to say?

519
00:30:10,756 --> 00:30:14,091
Yes.

520
00:30:14,091 --> 00:30:16,076
Please...

521
00:30:16,076 --> 00:30:18,750
let me know.

522
00:30:22,316 --> 00:30:24,079
Yes.

523
00:30:33,405 --> 00:30:35,399
I'm sorry.

524
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:46,554
I think this feels more natural.

525
00:31:03,871 --> 00:31:06,483
Wait...what did you say!!!

526
00:31:06,483 --> 00:31:07,821
Yay, Benoist!!!

527
00:31:07,821 --> 00:31:10,919
Run!!  We're under barrage!

528
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:14,342
It'll all be decided when we meet next time.

529
00:31:14,342 --> 00:31:17,318
We both know what the other is thinking.

530
00:31:17,318 --> 00:31:20,254
Or should I say we "found out".

531
00:31:20,254 --> 00:31:21,783
Hermes!!!

532
00:31:21,783 --> 00:31:22,446
It's a movie,

533
00:31:22,446 --> 00:31:23,071
a drama,

534
00:31:23,071 --> 00:31:23,944
a book.

535
00:31:23,944 --> 00:31:26,704
It's been a honour witnessing this miracle.

536
00:31:26,704 --> 00:31:30,056
Densha, you've grown beyond the realm of this forum.

537
00:31:30,056 --> 00:31:31,800
It's almost time for your graduation!

538
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:36,384
Densha, you've obtained Hermes!!

539
00:31:36,384 --> 00:31:37,863
It's still too early to say.

540
00:31:37,863 --> 00:31:39,736
You've come too far for it to fail.

541
00:31:39,736 --> 00:31:41,743
I'll say it in advance, congratulations!!!

542
00:31:41,743 --> 00:31:43,808
Hermes is awesome!!!

543
00:31:43,808 --> 00:31:45,616
She likes you for sure.  

544
00:31:45,616 --> 00:31:47,201
There's no need to wonder what to do.

545
00:31:47,201 --> 00:31:51,253
Yep, all I have to do is tell her how I feel on our next date.

546
00:31:51,288 --> 00:31:53,816
Ahh, everthing's going all white.

547
00:31:53,816 --> 00:31:56,273
Does anyone else want to

548
00:31:56,273 --> 00:31:58,455
pass beyond the light with me?

549
00:31:58,455 --> 00:32:00,299
I guess this is what they call a miracle.

550
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:02,752
Miracle... It's the result of your hardwork isn't?

551
00:32:02,752 --> 00:32:04,768
It's because you all supported me!!!

552
00:32:04,768 --> 00:32:07,104
If it wasn't for that old drunk,

553
00:32:07,104 --> 00:32:09,616
this miracle wouldn't have happened.

554
00:32:09,616 --> 00:32:11,745
What really made it happen,

555
00:32:11,745 --> 00:32:14,809
was your courage.

556
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:17,768
If you ignored what happened, we wouldn't be here.

557
00:32:17,768 --> 00:32:22,707
I'm proud that one of the
members on this forum was so brave.  Cheers!

558
00:32:23,022 --> 00:32:25,840
Cheers to our chief!*

559
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:27,726
Benoir!!

560
00:32:29,402 --> 00:32:31,745
What kinda racket you makin so late?

561
00:32:31,745 --> 00:32:34,509
Hurry yourself ta work!

562
00:32:34,509 --> 00:32:35,949
Dad.

563
00:32:36,557 --> 00:32:39,325
I was planning on leaving right now.

564
00:32:39,325 --> 00:32:41,907
You go on ahead.

565
00:32:49,328 --> 00:32:51,370
Comic Kingdom 14

566
00:32:53,637 --> 00:32:55,366
It's certainly quiet here now.

567
00:32:55,366 --> 00:32:57,078
You're not supposed to stay here overnight.

568
00:32:57,078 --> 00:32:59,245
Hey, where's Yamada-shi?

569
00:32:59,245 --> 00:33:03,055
He should be here on the first train.

570
00:33:04,734 --> 00:33:06,982
It's not here.  It's not here.

571
00:33:06,982 --> 00:33:09,919
Why, why isn't it here?

572
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:21,422
Why, why, why?

573
00:33:28,791 --> 00:33:32,080
Hello, Healthy Drink Bar, Ryu speaking.

574
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,239
This is Yamada calling.

575
00:33:33,239 --> 00:33:35,845
Aoyama-san's friend?

576
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,256
Um...

577
00:33:39,256 --> 00:33:40,032
What is it?

578
00:33:40,032 --> 00:33:42,295
Was there a blue envelope lying around there?

579
00:33:42,295 --> 00:33:44,376
No, I don't think so.

580
00:33:44,376 --> 00:33:46,766
I see...

581
00:33:46,766 --> 00:33:49,473
Was it something important?

582
00:33:49,473 --> 00:33:53,570
Uh.. well...

583
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:57,086
It's something I need at work.

584
00:33:57,086 --> 00:33:59,537
Sorry for disturbing you, thanks for your time.

585
00:34:09,836 --> 00:34:11,724
What's this?

586
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:19,174
What's this?

587
00:34:19,174 --> 00:34:21,224
Did someone forget it?

588
00:34:21,822 --> 00:34:24,254
Hey, this is-

589
00:34:27,993 --> 00:34:30,758
I'm so in trouble.

590
00:34:33,461 --> 00:34:35,089
 Why, why?

591
00:34:36,273 --> 00:34:37,793
He called?

592
00:34:37,793 --> 00:34:40,249
It seemed to be an important document for work.

593
00:34:40,249 --> 00:34:43,698
Ok, then I'll call him from here.

594
00:34:43,698 --> 00:34:45,845
Please let me in.

595
00:34:46,591 --> 00:34:47,261
Please.

596
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:49,497
You forgot your ticket right?

597
00:34:49,497 --> 00:34:50,371
That one doesn't work.

598
00:34:50,371 --> 00:34:52,154
If you could make an exception for me.

599
00:34:52,154 --> 00:34:54,242
Please.

600
00:34:55,489 --> 00:34:57,323
Yamada-shi, you're late.

601
00:34:57,323 --> 00:34:58,074
Please, let me in.

602
00:34:58,074 --> 00:34:59,132
Please.

603
00:34:59,132 --> 00:35:01,067
I'm begging you.

604
00:35:06,691 --> 00:35:08,235
You can take this in return.

605
00:35:08,235 --> 00:35:11,667
I got it after becoming a regular at this one maid cafe.

606
00:35:11,667 --> 00:35:12,787
Something that precious?

607
00:35:12,787 --> 00:35:13,748
And this too.

608
00:35:14,161 --> 00:35:17,098
This is a limited edition figure of Becky wearing glasses.

609
00:35:17,098 --> 00:35:18,136
I'll give this to you,

610
00:35:18,136 --> 00:35:19,499
so please let us in.

611
00:35:19,499 --> 00:35:20,347
Something so precious?

612
00:35:20,347 --> 00:35:21,867
So you're saying you don't have an entry pass?

613
00:35:21,867 --> 00:35:24,268
Please, we're begging you.

614
00:35:24,268 --> 00:35:25,995
Take 'em!

615
00:35:29,744 --> 00:35:33,412
The interrogation start here.  Now what are your specs?

616
00:35:35,897 --> 00:35:37,161
Hey Saori, what's up?

617
00:35:37,161 --> 00:35:38,433
Where are the documents?

618
00:35:38,433 --> 00:35:39,528
You came here to pick them up yourself?

619
00:35:39,528 --> 00:35:41,976
I couldn't get in touch with him, so I'll deliver them myself.

620
00:35:41,976 --> 00:35:43,697
It's probably this.

621
00:35:43,697 --> 00:35:44,760
Thanks.

622
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,331
I'm off then.

623
00:35:45,331 --> 00:35:46,408
Do you know where he works?

624
00:35:46,408 --> 00:35:48,257
He was saying something about the Tokyo Big Site.

625
00:35:48,257 --> 00:35:49,722
So you.

626
00:35:49,722 --> 00:35:51,657
She so wound up.

627
00:35:52,026 --> 00:35:54,594
She sure must like him.

628
00:35:59,384 --> 00:36:00,739
We can see our goal!

629
00:36:00,739 --> 00:36:02,531
Just a bit more...

630
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,046
Spare us.

631
00:36:12,046 --> 00:36:15,136
Ok, let's all sing Mina's theme song!

632
00:36:15,151 --> 00:36:15,582
1, 2-

633
00:36:30,305 --> 00:36:33,595
Love
Aoyama-san/Yamada Tsuyoshi


634
00:36:34,978 --> 00:36:39,876
It seems they met on the train when
he saved her from a drunk guy.

635
00:36:39,911 --> 00:36:42,251
On a train?

636
00:36:42,251 --> 00:36:44,241
From a drunk?

637
00:36:44,241 --> 00:36:46,235
There's an event of some kind going on.

638
00:36:46,235 --> 00:36:47,435
Then let me off here.

639
00:36:47,435 --> 00:36:49,315
Are you sure?  There's still a ways to go.

640
00:36:49,315 --> 00:36:51,259
That's ok.

641
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:59,886
And after that he faught off a stalker,

642
00:37:00,672 --> 00:37:01,599
and came to our house.

643
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,133
Faught off a stalker?

644
00:37:04,902 --> 00:37:09,186
And went to your house...

645
00:37:13,443 --> 00:37:15,591
So it's tomorrow then...
when Densha tells her how he feels.

646
00:37:15,591 --> 00:37:18,344
So this is it then.  It really makes you think.

647
00:37:18,344 --> 00:37:20,967
So this is the last day Densha will be single.

648
00:37:20,967 --> 00:37:23,295
Let's all send him off in a big way.

649
00:37:23,295 --> 00:37:25,568
I'm starting to get sad already.

650
00:37:25,568 --> 00:37:29,895
Tomorrow's the day when our comrade heads off his own way.

651
00:37:29,895 --> 00:37:32,280
Try to keep your eyes open till the end everyone!

652
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,720
We're all seeing at the same radiant glow.

653
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,561
Such a soft light.

654
00:37:36,561 --> 00:37:38,217
I'm glad we got him to call her that day.

655
00:37:38,217 --> 00:37:40,760
Why is it that I can't stop shaking?

656
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:45,227
We're all on the verge of seeing a legend being born!!

657
00:37:45,262 --> 00:37:47,929
I hope I can reach his level someday too...

658
00:37:47,929 --> 00:37:52,458
I like Densha and all of you guys too.  Benoist!!

659
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:55,641
Rooting for Densha became a daily ritual.

660
00:37:55,641 --> 00:37:58,097
What am I supposed to do now?

661
00:37:58,097 --> 00:37:59,481
Same here.

662
00:37:59,481 --> 00:38:02,225
I was worried about him all the time.

663
00:38:02,225 --> 00:38:05,050
He was our hope all along.

664
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:08,305
Our hope will be moving on tomorrow.

665
00:38:08,305 --> 00:38:11,448
This is really like a graduation.  I'm crying here.

666
00:38:11,448 --> 00:38:13,449
Everyone's ready right?

667
00:38:13,449 --> 00:38:16,673
Densha doesn't belong here anymore.

668
00:38:16,673 --> 00:38:20,280
I know we're all going to miss him, but...

669
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,961
Huh?  There's salt water in my eyes.

670
00:38:21,961 --> 00:38:23,226
My heart hurts.

671
00:38:23,226 --> 00:38:24,473
I'm crying already.

672
00:38:24,473 --> 00:38:27,401
Benoist!!!

673
00:38:35,711 --> 00:38:41,177
Comic Kingdom's Takeda Karin Live will start shortly.

674
00:38:42,191 --> 00:38:45,892
Those of you with tickets please line up in an orderly fashion.

675
00:38:45,927 --> 00:38:48,415
[Congratulations Densha Otoko]

676
00:38:48,958 --> 00:38:51,947
[You Graduate]

677
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,248
Karin-chan.  It's time.

678
00:38:58,248 --> 00:38:59,796
This way.

679
00:39:19,068 --> 00:39:20,239
What is it?

680
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:21,908
Mind the store.

681
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:24,102
What?  I have a date now.

682
00:39:24,473 --> 00:39:27,945
Then, then...close the store.

683
00:39:30,321 --> 00:39:31,921
I'm so sorry.

684
00:39:31,921 --> 00:39:34,906
Extreme circumstances call for extreme measures.

685
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:36,713
Let's sell them here.

686
00:39:36,713 --> 00:39:38,364
I'll help.

687
00:39:39,286 --> 00:39:40,551
Where should I put this?

688
00:39:40,551 --> 00:39:43,316
Put it where the wind won't knock it down.

689
00:39:47,553 --> 00:39:49,578
I came here to deliver this.

690
00:39:49,578 --> 00:39:52,816
Oh, those stubborn guys.

691
00:39:52,816 --> 00:39:55,437
They went that way.

692
00:40:00,569 --> 00:40:03,938
Hermes was Saori!!

693
00:40:06,435 --> 00:40:08,382
Sorry I was late.

694
00:40:12,514 --> 00:40:14,938
Sorry for asking you so suddenly.

695
00:40:14,938 --> 00:40:17,121
I got these from my Sister.

696
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:21,457
So these were the tickets?

697
00:40:21,587 --> 00:40:24,151
Nothing, let's go.

698
00:40:24,829 --> 00:40:27,542
Why are there so few people?

699
00:40:29,439 --> 00:40:30,493
Matsunaga-shi

700
00:40:30,493 --> 00:40:32,102
Wow,

701
00:40:32,102 --> 00:40:34,533
There's so much activity in there.

702
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:37,415
Kawamoto-shi, how did you get in?

703
00:40:42,087 --> 00:40:45,168
Wha!!  This hardly looks like CG at all!!

704
00:40:45,168 --> 00:40:47,304
But the ankles on mine look better.

705
00:40:47,304 --> 00:40:50,299
But the lip over here seem fuller.

706
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:54,826
Just look at the vivid colors!

707
00:40:54,826 --> 00:40:56,344
Amazing!

708
00:40:56,344 --> 00:40:58,824
Awesome.

709
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,409
They really show sophistication here.

710
00:41:05,409 --> 00:41:07,575
This is great.

711
00:41:10,906 --> 00:41:13,020
What is it Matsunaga-shi?

712
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:18,465
Yamada-shi, it's bad if someone finds out you're an Otaku right?

713
00:41:26,547 --> 00:41:28,666
I think a greeting is in order here.

714
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:29,909
That's true.

715
00:41:31,701 --> 00:41:32,828
I'm like, so dead.

716
00:41:32,829 --> 00:41:35,044
And the weather's like, so awesome.

717
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:36,851
This weather's like bodacious.

718
00:41:36,851 --> 00:41:39,811
Yeah, bodacious.

719
00:41:40,624 --> 00:41:43,661
Like, thank so much for dinner last time.

720
00:41:43,661 --> 00:41:46,904
Meeting you here is like, far out.

721
00:41:48,004 --> 00:41:50,228
Matsunaga-shi, your thing.

722
00:41:50,228 --> 00:41:52,724
Sea Turtles laying eggs!

723
00:41:52,724 --> 00:41:55,091
Like, its so awesome!

724
00:41:55,622 --> 00:41:57,375
Like, they're going to come out.

725
00:41:57,375 --> 00:42:00,609
Like, they're totally flowing out.

726
00:42:08,669 --> 00:42:10,408
Matsunaga-shi.

727
00:42:10,942 --> 00:42:12,628
Matsunaga-shi, we're not needed her anymore.

728
00:42:13,136 --> 00:42:14,957
Oh my gosh, it's like they're spawing!

729
00:42:58,774 --> 00:43:00,459
Um...

730
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:03,710
Today...

731
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:06,484
I was sort of...

732
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:12,222
So you didn't have work?

733
00:43:13,537 --> 00:43:15,496
No.

734
00:43:17,549 --> 00:43:19,699
It's..

735
00:43:21,815 --> 00:43:24,236
I'm sorry.

736
00:43:31,158 --> 00:43:34,386
To be honest, I was surprised.

737
00:43:37,361 --> 00:43:39,606
Yes.

738
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:47,475
So you..

739
00:43:51,559 --> 00:43:54,643
lied to me.

740
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,826
I thought finally...

741
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:11,837
I'm so sorry.

742
00:44:12,815 --> 00:44:14,594
I...

743
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,896
At such an important time...

744
00:44:19,896 --> 00:44:22,516
I...

745
00:44:31,705 --> 00:44:35,084
I believed in you.

746
00:46:17,213 --> 00:46:20,548
Next Episode

747
00:46:48,089 --> 00:46:49,609
