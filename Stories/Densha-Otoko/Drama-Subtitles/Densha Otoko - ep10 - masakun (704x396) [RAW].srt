1
00:00:02,219 --> 00:00:04,558
What's wrong?  You're scaring me.

2
00:00:04,558 --> 00:00:07,176
Sis, you've been had by that Yamada guy.

3
00:00:07,176 --> 00:00:11,269
That bastard...  Was talking about you on the internet!

4
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:13,499
How you two met...  Your fears...

5
00:00:13,499 --> 00:00:18,132
He showed it all on the internet and made a fool out of you!

6
00:00:18,132 --> 00:00:20,193
You're kidding...

7
00:00:20,193 --> 00:00:21,355
I can't...

8
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,453
This is unbelievable.

9
00:00:23,453 --> 00:00:25,828
He betrayed you.

10
00:00:25,828 --> 00:00:26,890
Here, look.

11
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,348
The time with the stalker...

12
00:00:28,348 --> 00:00:31,500
Our parents' divorce...  Stuff that should've been kept private...

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,051
He talks about it all in detail!

14
00:00:33,051 --> 00:00:33,900
Please, stop!

15
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,461
Oh no, it's not just that

16
00:00:35,461 --> 00:00:39,264
There's all this other sick ramblings about you on this board!

17
00:00:39,264 --> 00:00:40,454
Saori

18
00:00:40,454 --> 00:00:42,080
Yamada's here.

19
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,752
That bastard...

20
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:48,003
Keisuke?

21
00:00:53,862 --> 00:00:57,531
Good morning.

22
00:00:57,531 --> 00:00:58,920
Um, what...

23
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,546
You made a show out of sis all over the internet

24
00:01:01,546 --> 00:01:05,602
Keisuke, stop.

25
00:01:05,602 --> 00:01:14,097
Let him explain himself.

26
00:01:14,097 --> 00:01:18,969
I heard about the message board

27
00:01:18,969 --> 00:01:21,482
...and about how you wrote about me on it...

28
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:23,362
...is that true?

29
00:01:23,362 --> 00:01:27,941
Oh...  Um...  Well, that...

30
00:01:27,941 --> 00:01:30,496
So it was true.

31
00:01:30,496 --> 00:01:32,646
Well...  Actually...

32
00:01:32,646 --> 00:01:34,880
I came here to talk about that...

33
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,948
Was it fun?

34
00:01:37,948 --> 00:01:39,859
Talking about me...

35
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:43,192
having a good laugh from talking about me...

36
00:01:43,192 --> 00:01:44,504
...was it fun?

37
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:47,847
That's not what I was trying to do.

38
00:01:47,847 --> 00:01:49,576
That board...

39
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:50,824
I...

40
00:01:50,824 --> 00:01:53,931
...didn't know how to date women, and so...

41
00:01:53,931 --> 00:01:56,770
I don't want to hear it.

42
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:05,202
I was a fool for believing in you.

43
00:02:05,202 --> 00:02:08,170
Please...

44
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:16,443
...don't show yourself in front of me again.

45
00:02:16,443 --> 00:02:18,252
You've got it wrong!

46
00:02:18,252 --> 00:02:21,752
Sis's world is way too different from yours.

47
00:02:32,812 --> 00:02:36,679
Wait, please...  Stop!
(In Japanese culture, a man will say 'mother' to his wife...)

48
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:38,816
I only wanted to talk to you...
(...since family members address each other using...)

49
00:02:38,816 --> 00:02:41,393
It's not like I'm going to turn on the TV!
(...the point of view of the youngest in the family)

50
00:02:44,535 --> 00:02:47,109
You okay?

51
00:02:47,109 --> 00:02:49,870
No, I'm not okay, thanks.

52
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,960
Yeah, I guess not...

53
00:02:54,971 --> 00:03:02,032
C'mon, c'mon!

54
00:03:02,032 --> 00:03:06,015
It's fixed!

55
00:03:06,015 --> 00:03:10,241
Densha!  I've returned!

56
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,815
I've been...  Totally shut out by Hermes...

57
00:03:14,815 --> 00:03:18,690
...this time, it's the end...  For real...

58
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,471
What happened...

59
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:22,211
...while I was away?

60
00:03:32,403 --> 00:03:34,612
The details!

61
00:03:34,612 --> 00:03:38,894
Densha Otoko

66
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,138
See, I told you not to spill the beans on this board!

67
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:01,468
It's Densha's choice.  There isn't much we can do about it.

68
00:04:01,468 --> 00:04:04,428
Why didn't I stop him from telling her...  I'm such an idiot!

69
00:04:04,428 --> 00:04:06,737
Is it because you told her about this place?

70
00:04:06,737 --> 00:04:11,076
By the time I got there, she had already found out.

71
00:04:11,076 --> 00:04:13,773
It seemed like her brother told her about this.

72
00:04:13,773 --> 00:04:14,831
Shit, she found out on her own!

73
00:04:14,831 --> 00:04:15,832
Her younger brother?

74
00:04:15,832 --> 00:04:19,110
I can't believe this board found its way so close to her!

75
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,336
Well, even a middle schooler like me knew about this. (*1)

76
00:04:21,336 --> 00:04:23,079
Who built up all the excitement about this board!?

77
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,532
That would be us...  and you.

78
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:25,756
I'm so sorry, momma.  (*2)

79
00:04:25,756 --> 00:04:27,889
So, in other words, is Hermes reading this board?

80
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:30,505
Wow I sat up straight when I realized Hermes might be looking.

81
00:04:30,505 --> 00:04:34,836
Hermes!  Oh, um, I should get changed!

82
00:04:34,836 --> 00:04:37,661
I really don't think she'll be looking here.

83
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:41,174
Both Hermes and her younger brother...

84
00:04:41,174 --> 00:04:43,511
...didn't like this board one bit.

85
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:45,080
I guess it can't be helped if they're inclined to think that way.

86
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,007
That's how girls usually feel about us.

87
00:04:48,007 --> 00:04:50,331
I feel relieved, but also kinda sad...

88
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,256
I guess I can write here a little easier.

89
00:04:52,256 --> 00:04:56,409
How'd she turn you down without having even looked here?

90
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:59,256
I think it was a bit much for her when she realized...

91
00:04:59,256 --> 00:05:02,975
...that she was being talked about behind her back.

92
00:05:02,975 --> 00:05:06,714
I tried explaining but my words fell on deaf ears...

93
00:05:06,714 --> 00:05:08,617
You have to set the record straight - there's still hope.

94
00:05:08,617 --> 00:05:10,752
You went out to tell her about this place, anyway.

95
00:05:10,752 --> 00:05:12,112
Come on, you can't give up here!

96
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:13,822
Just keep explaining it to her until she understands!

97
00:05:13,822 --> 00:05:16,833
We are now departing for the House of Hermes!

98
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,443
It's impossible.

99
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,612
Her younger brother...

100
00:05:19,612 --> 00:05:23,040
told me that Hermes and I come from different worlds...

101
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,367
...and that really made me feel like I'm not someone...

102
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,353
...who is suitable for Hermes.

103
00:05:28,353 --> 00:05:31,357
Even if I she understands about this board...

104
00:05:31,357 --> 00:05:34,837
...someone like me won't be able to keep her happy...

105
00:05:34,837 --> 00:05:36,253
...in a relationship...

106
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,163
...even if I got that far.

107
00:05:38,163 --> 00:05:39,304
I thought I was struggling for her...

108
00:05:39,304 --> 00:05:42,199
...when I threw away my otakuness...

109
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:45,887
...but I was working hard so she wouldn't dislike me...

110
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,967
...and it wasn't an effort to get her to like me.

111
00:05:48,967 --> 00:05:50,977
...it really wasn't.

112
00:05:50,977 --> 00:05:54,513
I only realized this after she asked me...

113
00:05:54,513 --> 00:05:57,975
...to not show myself to her again.

114
00:05:57,975 --> 00:06:01,733
I don't think there's going to be...

115
00:06:01,733 --> 00:06:04,489
...anything more between the two of us.

116
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,615
Hey!

117
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,055
Are you really okay with that!?

118
00:06:08,055 --> 00:06:09,547
It's too early to throw in the towel!

119
00:06:09,547 --> 00:06:11,514
Give it another shot!

120
00:06:11,514 --> 00:06:14,199
Come on, we've got your back!

121
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,627
I think that's enough.

122
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:36,300
You did really well.

123
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,993
At first, I looked down on you, Densha.

124
00:06:38,993 --> 00:06:42,281
Getting all worked up all over a phone call to thank her...

125
00:06:42,281 --> 00:06:46,950
...it was like we all had to push you up and give you support...

126
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,279
but...

127
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:51,058
...now you're way ahead of the rest of us.

128
00:06:51,058 --> 00:06:53,816
After all this, if you think it's time to give up...

129
00:06:53,816 --> 00:06:56,242
...then that must really be the case.

130
00:06:56,242 --> 00:06:58,938
You did really well.

131
00:06:58,938 --> 00:07:00,506
Take care. (*3)

132
00:07:00,506 --> 00:07:02,941
I guess guys like us...

133
00:07:02,941 --> 00:07:05,035
have no right to second-guess the choice you made.

134
00:07:05,035 --> 00:07:06,866
It would just be an exercise in futility.

135
00:07:06,866 --> 00:07:09,777
This time around, it's a lot more than you lying to her.

136
00:07:09,777 --> 00:07:12,988
I know it's tough, but use this as a lesson and go look for someone else.

137
00:07:12,988 --> 00:07:16,056
No way!  It's too frustrating to see it end like this!

138
00:07:16,056 --> 00:07:19,287
Densha, let's go back to the home of the Single Man.

139
00:07:19,287 --> 00:07:21,589
Densha Otoko...  You're a real man!

140
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:24,259
And to think that a newbie like me built a bomb shelter and was hiding in it...

141
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:25,577
Me too!

142
00:07:25,577 --> 00:07:27,564
Give it another shot!

143
00:07:27,564 --> 00:07:28,812
You did well.

144
00:07:28,812 --> 00:07:30,807
You gave courage to all of us.

145
00:07:30,807 --> 00:07:33,494
Thanks to Densha, it looks like I'll fail my entrance exams again.

146
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,612
For now...  Just build up your muscles!

147
00:07:35,612 --> 00:07:38,382
Thanks for the World Cup-class feeling you gave me!

148
00:07:38,382 --> 00:07:41,209
Last stop...  Last stop...

149
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:44,021
Densha, I'm sure you'll find a wonderful person soon!

150
00:07:44,021 --> 00:07:47,266
Hey I've been dumped 15 times in a row.  No worries!

151
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,825
Densha, I really liked you.

152
00:07:49,825 --> 00:07:53,673
I'll treasure the three months I spent with you, Densha.

153
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,752
I don't think...

154
00:08:00,752 --> 00:08:03,691
I'll ever write here again...

155
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:08,251
...but I'll never forget you guys...

156
00:08:08,251 --> 00:08:10,398
Thank you so much.

157
00:08:10,398 --> 00:08:12,007
Thank you so much.

158
00:08:32,552 --> 00:08:35,593
Shoot, I can't find anything to do again...

159
00:09:39,874 --> 00:09:43,814
(you know he's crying for real when there's snot coming out of his mouth...)

160
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:05,828
Matsunaga...  Matsunaga...  Matsunaga...  Matsunaga...

161
00:10:05,828 --> 00:10:06,821
You mean the sea turtle?

162
00:10:06,821 --> 00:10:07,242
Yeah.

163
00:10:07,242 --> 00:10:10,029
Actually, he isn't just a sea turtle.

164
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:11,991
He's a sea turtle who gives birth to money!

165
00:10:11,991 --> 00:10:14,594
Apparently he owns a lot of land in Nagoya.

166
00:10:14,594 --> 00:10:16,212
He makes $300k a year without lifting a finger!

167
00:10:16,212 --> 00:10:17,185
Can you believe this?

168
00:10:17,185 --> 00:10:19,255
I found a treasure somewhere I didn't expect.

169
00:10:19,255 --> 00:10:21,182
Hey hey hey, look here.

170
00:10:21,182 --> 00:10:23,983
His handsome eyebrows and his bangs that aren't parted anywhere...

171
00:10:23,983 --> 00:10:26,454
They hint at the look of a heir to a noble family!

172
00:10:26,454 --> 00:10:29,125
Senpai, are you really going after Sea Turtle?

173
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,566
After we get back from our business trip to Italy...

174
00:10:30,566 --> 00:10:32,484
...we're going on a date!

175
00:10:32,484 --> 00:10:33,915
Do you have no sense of pride?

176
00:10:33,915 --> 00:10:36,682
I threw that out to the sewer as soon as I hit 30.

177
00:10:36,682 --> 00:10:37,675
Sorry

178
00:10:37,675 --> 00:10:38,359
What's wrong?

179
00:10:38,359 --> 00:10:40,870
You're usually not late to work, Saori.

180
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:45,198
Here, your plane tickets.

181
00:10:45,198 --> 00:10:46,693
What's wrong?

182
00:10:46,693 --> 00:10:47,936
It looks like you cried.

183
00:10:47,936 --> 00:10:49,886
Did something happen between you and Yamada again?

184
00:10:49,886 --> 00:10:53,675
I've decided not to see him anymore.

185
00:10:53,675 --> 00:10:54,451
Huh?

186
00:10:54,451 --> 00:10:55,360
This time

187
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,829
it really is the end.

188
00:10:56,829 --> 00:11:02,219
What do you mean?

189
00:11:02,219 --> 00:11:03,428
What's up with him?

190
00:11:03,428 --> 00:11:06,372
He said something about a love rivalry he started on his own and lost.

191
00:11:06,372 --> 00:11:07,556
I see...

192
00:11:07,556 --> 00:11:10,059
Hey, so it's true that Yamada and Saori broke up?

193
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:11,661
What?  They broke up?

194
00:11:11,661 --> 00:11:13,456
It's not like they were going out in the first place

195
00:11:13,456 --> 00:11:16,076
That Densha...  What the hell is wrong with him?

196
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:18,873
I've gone through so much shit because of that guy.

197
00:11:18,873 --> 00:11:20,237
Hm?

198
00:11:20,237 --> 00:11:21,426
Wait a minute.

199
00:11:21,426 --> 00:11:24,779
That means that Saori is available again.

200
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:28,693
Looks like I have some loss time left!
(it's a footbal, ahem, soccer term for all you Americans out there)

201
00:11:28,693 --> 00:11:29,566
Hey

202
00:11:29,566 --> 00:11:30,827
So what happened?

203
00:11:30,827 --> 00:11:34,045
Saori isn't telling us anything.

204
00:11:34,045 --> 00:11:35,109
You um...

205
00:11:35,109 --> 00:11:41,677
have a couple of minutes?

206
00:11:41,677 --> 00:11:44,586
You told your sister about the BBS right?

207
00:11:44,586 --> 00:11:46,211
What exactly did you tell her?

208
00:11:46,211 --> 00:11:47,817
I just told her the straight and simple truth.

209
00:11:47,817 --> 00:11:50,609
Tell me what the straight truth is!

210
00:12:00,254 --> 00:12:02,412
God damn it, tell me!

211
00:12:02,412 --> 00:12:05,376
You're playing a totally different role...

212
00:12:05,376 --> 00:12:07,570
This is the real me, bitch!

213
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,727
And?

214
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:10,348
He was posting up all these stories about her...

215
00:12:10,348 --> 00:12:12,600
making fun of her every problem and making a fool out of her.

216
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,309
Did you even actually read the board?

217
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:16,595
I couldn't even get myself to read it.

218
00:12:16,595 --> 00:12:18,505
Unbelievable.

219
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:20,406
This is why I hate boys!

220
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,762
What the hell do you mean by that?

221
00:12:22,762 --> 00:12:28,175
Read the board, dammit!

222
00:12:28,175 --> 00:12:30,086
What is that?

223
00:12:30,086 --> 00:12:33,028
So what's this board she's talking about?

224
00:12:33,028 --> 00:12:35,215
Sorry.

225
00:12:35,215 --> 00:12:36,784
Misuzu san!

226
00:12:36,784 --> 00:12:38,979
Aladdin~ Channel~

227
00:12:38,979 --> 00:12:41,513
Saori and~ Yamada~

228
00:12:41,513 --> 00:12:44,253
It has the secret~

229
00:12:44,253 --> 00:12:47,354
To their breakup~

230
00:12:47,354 --> 00:12:49,437
Now what's up!

231
00:12:50,474 --> 00:12:52,169
We're going to Italy for work

232
00:12:52,169 --> 00:12:53,609
But we might as well have a good time there.

233
00:12:53,609 --> 00:12:55,251
It'll be a good break for us.

234
00:12:55,251 --> 00:12:57,403
Yeah.

235
00:12:57,403 --> 00:12:58,565
Sorry!

236
00:12:58,565 --> 00:12:59,400
Too much to drink

237
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,489
last night.

238
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:02,395
You're late!

239
00:13:02,395 --> 00:13:03,487
Okay, let's go.

240
00:13:07,684 --> 00:13:08,809
That dumbass Yamada!

241
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:10,862
Calling in sick for 3 days in a row...

242
00:13:10,862 --> 00:13:18,257
Okay you know what I can fire him.

243
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:20,730
Mrs. Yamada?  Hi, this is Kuroki, his boss...

244
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,174
I was wondering if Yamada was home?

245
00:13:22,174 --> 00:13:22,846
Yes, yes.

246
00:13:22,846 --> 00:13:24,356
Well I was hoping to get him to write his 2 weeks' notice

247
00:13:24,356 --> 00:13:25,586
Yes, yes, yes.

248
00:13:25,586 --> 00:13:27,836
I got disconnected.

249
00:13:27,836 --> 00:13:29,373
Oikawa?  What is it?

250
00:13:29,373 --> 00:13:32,908
I...  I don't dislike him, you know...

251
00:13:32,908 --> 00:13:34,275
Well, Oikawa, even if it's you, I can't let you...

252
00:13:34,275 --> 00:13:37,790
...speak out against my decisions based on your likes or dislikes.

253
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:42,187
Well, I guess I have no choice.

254
00:13:42,187 --> 00:13:46,432
What?

255
00:13:46,432 --> 00:13:47,357
Hello.

256
00:13:47,357 --> 00:13:50,179
Jinkama-san...

257
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:50,979
Why are you...

258
00:13:50,979 --> 00:13:52,128
Just let me in.
(literally she is saying, "serve me tea")

259
00:13:52,128 --> 00:13:55,793
Huh?

260
00:13:57,385 --> 00:14:00,698
So you got dumped?

261
00:14:00,698 --> 00:14:02,050
How did you..

262
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,393
Oh it was just a rumor going around.

263
00:14:04,393 --> 00:14:06,059
I see.

264
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:12,893
Well, I mean, it's not like a guy like you had much of a chance.

265
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:13,727
Look.

266
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,922
It's like "The Lady and the Otaku."

267
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:18,064
It's even less conceivable than "Beauty and the Beast."

268
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:29,018
Dammit, I hate these depressing moods.

269
00:14:29,018 --> 00:14:30,328
Take your clothes off.

270
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:31,729
Huh?

271
00:14:31,729 --> 00:14:34,756
Well, it's partly my fault too

272
00:14:34,756 --> 00:14:37,386
Looks like I have no choice.

273
00:14:37,386 --> 00:14:39,753
When you lose someone, you gotta find someone new, right?

274
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,263
Wh...  What are you doing?

275
00:14:41,263 --> 00:14:42,648
Just shut up!

276
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:44,102
Let me do my thing.

277
00:14:44,102 --> 00:14:46,267
Spare me, please!

278
00:14:46,267 --> 00:14:48,962
How long are you gonna drag this on for?

279
00:14:48,962 --> 00:14:51,472
There are plenty of girls like that out there.

280
00:14:51,472 --> 00:14:54,487
No...  There aren't.

281
00:14:54,487 --> 00:14:56,702
Someone so lovely...

282
00:14:56,702 --> 00:15:00,689
There isn't anyone but her.

283
00:15:00,689 --> 00:15:03,393
So you're saying I'm different?

284
00:15:03,393 --> 00:15:06,139
Then I'll show you...  With my body!

285
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:06,906
Please...  Anything but that!

286
00:15:11,128 --> 00:15:13,123
Nice to meet you.

287
00:15:13,123 --> 00:15:14,280
Same to you.

288
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,465
Sorry to bother you two.

289
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,222
Hey what's that you're doing?

290
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:34,928
Oh.  It's nothing.

291
00:15:34,928 --> 00:15:36,478
There's the food.
(Notice how she said 'kita, kita' like the BBS...)

292
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:39,112
Oh wow, that looks really good!

293
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:51,133
I finally put the pieces together.

294
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:54,268
I had some stuff going on and was away from the board for a while.

295
00:15:54,268 --> 00:15:55,841
I'm finally caught up.

296
00:15:55,841 --> 00:15:58,545
Looks like Densha got dumped.

297
00:15:58,545 --> 00:16:01,107
Yeah.  I'm so sleepy...

298
00:16:01,107 --> 00:16:03,430
Not as many people come here anymore - it's deserted.

299
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,678
With the lead character gone, nobody is gonna come in.

300
00:16:05,678 --> 00:16:08,765
Why'd you guys let him off the train early?

301
00:16:08,765 --> 00:16:14,728
At this rate, he won't be any different from before!

302
00:16:14,728 --> 00:16:17,483
Densha closed the curtains on his own free will.

303
00:16:17,483 --> 00:16:19,900
He evolved into oru army's deadliest weapon.

304
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,916
And then, he became a star.

305
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:24,419
It's true that he took a pretty nasty fall.

306
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:27,562
But, all of us were hoping that Densha

307
00:16:27,562 --> 00:16:28,847
would be able to work things out with Hermes!

308
00:16:28,847 --> 00:16:31,527
We don't need a rookie like you to tell us that.

309
00:16:31,527 --> 00:16:34,229
Some things in this world just can't be helped.  That's just how it is.

310
00:16:34,229 --> 00:16:37,348
We all did the best we could, I think...

311
00:16:37,348 --> 00:16:40,268
I didn't think that it would work for sure.

312
00:16:40,268 --> 00:16:43,299
But I just don't want him to leave any regrets.

313
00:16:43,299 --> 00:16:46,882
He still hasn't told Hermes how he feels about her!

314
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:52,095
He can give up after he does that, right?

315
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:53,926
It's too late for that.

316
00:16:53,926 --> 00:16:57,119
He won't appear on this board again.

317
00:16:57,119 --> 00:17:01,092
I guess we were all only connected by a telephone line...

318
00:17:01,092 --> 00:17:03,867
That's why you guys are stuck here.

319
00:17:03,867 --> 00:17:07,881
There's no way we could help Densha if we can't even change ourselves!

320
00:17:07,881 --> 00:17:10,702
Isn't there anyone who says that we have to take him back here

321
00:17:10,702 --> 00:17:21,378
and convince him to tell Hermes how he feels?

322
00:17:21,378 --> 00:17:22,686
It's useless to say such things.

323
00:17:22,686 --> 00:17:26,434
I'm upset too.  But if Densha is like that...

324
00:17:26,434 --> 00:17:28,120
Maybe I'll give it a try...

325
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,246
Hey hey, you're just gonna hurt Densha again.

326
00:17:30,246 --> 00:17:31,571
No!

327
00:17:31,571 --> 00:17:34,991
If you're scared of getting hurt and run away...  That's just like us!

328
00:17:34,991 --> 00:17:37,394
Densha is our final weapon.

329
00:17:37,394 --> 00:17:40,509
This is an illusion.  He's already reached his limit!

330
00:17:40,509 --> 00:17:43,800
Did you forget about the power of that destructive weapon?

331
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,086
Who's going to help Densha if we don't?

332
00:17:46,086 --> 00:17:48,405
Only the guys who want to help him out should remain here.

333
00:17:48,405 --> 00:17:52,253
You guys are all...  So stupid!

334
00:17:52,253 --> 00:17:54,614
I call a toast to all of you who are rushing to die.

335
00:17:54,614 --> 00:17:58,190
We have to inject Densha with all of our powers!

336
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:00,454
Mr. Strategist, I hope you have a plan.

337
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,548
Of course!  Tomorrow is Sunday.

338
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:05,635
There's a good chance that a depressed Densha will go to Akiba!

339
00:18:05,635 --> 00:18:07,830
How about an Akiba Infiltration Plan?

340
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,050
Densha was telling us before that he lives near the Chuo line

341
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,413
Let's wait for him there!

342
00:18:11,413 --> 00:18:12,823
I'll announce it at the station!

343
00:18:12,823 --> 00:18:15,411
I'll have a live street performance at Akiba!

344
00:18:15,411 --> 00:18:18,021
I'll scream "Densha" in the middle of Akiba! (*4)
(You ever hear of 'Sekai no Chuusin de Ai wo Sakebu?)

345
00:18:18,021 --> 00:18:20,139
I'll call out to him from 3000 ft. in the air

346
00:18:20,139 --> 00:18:22,374
I'll write and publish a book about Densha!

347
00:18:22,374 --> 00:18:24,103
I'll recruit soldiers at Akiba!

348
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,346
I'll buy up they city of Akiba and look for Densha that way.

349
00:18:26,346 --> 00:18:28,949
I'll set up multiple traps on other message boards

350
00:18:28,949 --> 00:18:31,843
You guys are all such good people.

351
00:18:31,843 --> 00:18:34,830
Working so hard to help out someone else...

352
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,998
If I had guys like you around...

353
00:18:36,998 --> 00:18:39,942
...my life would've been more fun.

354
00:18:39,942 --> 00:18:41,771
What are you talking about?

355
00:18:41,771 --> 00:18:44,807
We're your friends, too.

356
00:18:44,807 --> 00:18:48,103
When you run into a wall you can't overcome yourself...

357
00:18:48,103 --> 00:18:50,830
We'll be there for you.

358
00:19:10,258 --> 00:19:12,661
I'm a total loner, but..

359
00:19:12,661 --> 00:19:14,930
I'll make some flyers for Densha and put them all over Akiba!

360
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,293
That's a good idea.  Just make sure you get the city's permission!

361
00:19:17,293 --> 00:19:19,568
Then I'll put myself on TV and call out to him!

362
00:19:19,568 --> 00:19:22,655
Okay, we'll put him back on this board for sure!

363
00:19:47,664 --> 00:19:50,768
Well, I guess I should start making some leaflets.

364
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:32,704
(He's calling out train stations like a conductor)

365
00:20:33,988 --> 00:20:34,636
Daddy

366
00:20:34,636 --> 00:20:36,575
So who is this Densha guy?

367
00:20:36,575 --> 00:20:39,144
Heck if I know.

368
00:20:39,144 --> 00:20:41,557
Hey, it's Yamada!

369
00:20:41,557 --> 00:20:43,022
You know that person?

370
00:20:43,022 --> 00:20:45,326
Yeah, he helps me out with my video games.

371
00:20:46,238 --> 00:20:48,704
Oh yeah, I memorized the Nanbu line.

372
00:20:48,704 --> 00:20:49,438
Let's hear it.

373
00:20:49,438 --> 00:20:52,708
Tachikawa, Nishi-Kunitachi, Yaho...

374
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:53,801
No.

375
00:20:53,801 --> 00:20:57,089
After Nishi-Kunitachi, the next stop is Yagawa

376
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:01,085
Tachikawa, Nishi-Kunitachi, Yagawa, Yaho...

377
00:21:10,094 --> 00:21:12,427
This is scary.

378
00:21:12,427 --> 00:21:16,236
It's so bright...

379
00:21:16,236 --> 00:21:19,671
Sorry, sorry...

380
00:21:25,377 --> 00:21:28,312
[Densha Otoko!  Come back to the board!]
[A Channel members]

381
00:21:28,697 --> 00:21:31,811
Densha-san, don't give up!
[Densha Otoko, read the board!]

382
00:21:31,811 --> 00:21:35,187
Even if Hermes doesn't like you anymore

383
00:21:35,187 --> 00:21:39,092
Just take another look at the message board

384
00:21:46,051 --> 00:21:49,510
Shall we hold hands?

385
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:52,598
He...  He...  Here...

386
00:22:11,647 --> 00:22:15,227
That caught me off guard, you sighed before saying hi.

387
00:22:15,227 --> 00:22:17,329
Mr. Matsunaga, I know you don't have luck with women, but...

388
00:22:17,329 --> 00:22:18,876
shaking hands like that with a guy...

389
00:22:18,876 --> 00:22:21,057
...is a little too fishy.

390
00:22:21,057 --> 00:22:21,978
How dare you!

391
00:22:21,978 --> 00:22:24,154
It's not like I don't have a girlfriend, you know.

392
00:22:24,154 --> 00:22:27,476
A girlfriend?

393
00:22:27,732 --> 00:22:28,426
Mr. Yamada!

394
00:22:28,426 --> 00:22:36,977
It's been a while since you decided to meet up with us.

395
00:22:36,977 --> 00:22:42,383
[Densha, tell her!]

396
00:22:42,383 --> 00:22:47,302
Here you go.

397
00:22:47,302 --> 00:22:49,436
He is at the 15th hole...

398
00:22:51,223 --> 00:22:52,693
Hey, are you looking at this?

399
00:22:52,693 --> 00:22:55,680
Densha, come back to the message board!

400
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,168
Stay tuned for the next episode of Mina!

401
00:23:09,942 --> 00:23:11,420
Densha

402
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,473
It's too bad...

403
00:23:12,473 --> 00:23:14,757
but while you're sulking around like that...

404
00:23:14,757 --> 00:23:18,796
my lethal weapon has found Hermes within striking range.

405
00:23:25,917 --> 00:23:26,790
Oh

406
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,689
He's so handsome.

407
00:23:27,689 --> 00:23:30,629
The weak-hearted Saori...

408
00:23:30,629 --> 00:23:35,104
...she couldn't refuse her mother's suggestions...

409
00:23:39,116 --> 00:23:42,496
I was so surprised to hear that you were my date, Kazuya.

410
00:23:42,496 --> 00:23:44,121
I was shocked too.

411
00:23:44,121 --> 00:23:46,995
To hear that you were Hermes...

412
00:23:46,995 --> 00:23:49,511
I'll have to thank Densha.

413
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:52,521
Thanks to him, our love has grown...

414
00:23:59,091 --> 00:24:07,513
Look there.

415
00:24:07,513 --> 00:24:09,248
It's so hot.

416
00:24:12,282 --> 00:24:15,481
What the hell?  Messing up in my fantasy?

417
00:24:15,481 --> 00:24:17,765
Wait a minute!

418
00:24:17,765 --> 00:24:20,658
Things never went according to my plans, so..

419
00:24:20,658 --> 00:24:25,811
..does that mean that this time, it'll work?

420
00:24:25,811 --> 00:24:27,134
Densha

421
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:28,674
Sorry.

422
00:24:28,674 --> 00:24:31,305
This time, for real, Hermes will be mine.

423
00:24:40,133 --> 00:24:43,007
What're you doing?

424
00:24:43,007 --> 00:24:44,332
This is...

425
00:24:44,332 --> 00:24:45,078
Sorry.

426
00:24:45,078 --> 00:24:45,914
I heard from Keisuke.

427
00:24:45,914 --> 00:24:48,007
But even then...

428
00:24:48,007 --> 00:24:52,056
Saori, listen to me.

429
00:24:52,056 --> 00:24:53,103
You know, I...

430
00:24:53,103 --> 00:24:55,478
When I first heard of this board, I was really upset...

431
00:24:55,478 --> 00:24:58,013
and thought about confronting Yamada.

432
00:24:58,013 --> 00:25:02,180
You know I didn't like him at all, right?

433
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,790
He was such an Otaku...

434
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:07,615
But, Saori...

435
00:25:07,615 --> 00:25:08,578
This message board...

436
00:25:08,578 --> 00:25:09,963
take a look.

437
00:25:09,963 --> 00:25:10,425
On here...

438
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,934
Stop it.

439
00:25:11,934 --> 00:25:14,773
I can't stand it.

440
00:25:14,773 --> 00:25:17,692
Saori!

441
00:25:20,388 --> 00:25:22,786
Why a radio show, even when there aren't any guests?

442
00:25:22,786 --> 00:25:25,127
I heard that Karin Takeda, who's been out of the spotlight for a while

443
00:25:25,127 --> 00:25:28,336
will be a special live guest via internet.

444
00:25:28,336 --> 00:25:29,578
For real?

445
00:25:29,578 --> 00:25:31,659
I'll need to record this!

446
00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:32,756
This is...

447
00:25:32,756 --> 00:25:37,243
a sudden notice, so only a handful of fans know about...

448
00:25:37,243 --> 00:25:38,110
Why?

449
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:40,796
Okay, so we're about to start this show...

450
00:25:40,796 --> 00:25:42,483
with our on-site exclusive secret guest!

451
00:25:42,483 --> 00:25:46,498
Looks like everyone in front of the studio might know who she is.

452
00:25:46,498 --> 00:25:47,842
To everyone listening on the radio...

453
00:25:47,842 --> 00:25:50,041
we're really sorry - and be a little jealous, will you?

454
00:25:50,041 --> 00:25:52,528
On air we have, from Los Angeles,

455
00:25:52,528 --> 00:25:54,934
via internet video feed, Karin-chan!

456
00:25:54,934 --> 00:25:56,401
Karin-chan?

457
00:25:56,401 --> 00:25:57,733
Yes?

458
00:25:57,733 --> 00:25:59,510
How's everyone doing?

459
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:01,995
We're all doing great!

460
00:26:01,995 --> 00:26:03,197
Right now, Karin-chan is

461
00:26:03,197 --> 00:26:04,300
studying acting, and

462
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,310
that's why she's in LA, but...

463
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:09,021
why did you decide to do a radio show all the sudden?

464
00:26:09,021 --> 00:26:11,115
Well, that...

465
00:26:11,115 --> 00:26:13,786
I wanted to send a message...

466
00:26:13,786 --> 00:26:15,437
to someone who guided me...

467
00:26:15,437 --> 00:26:19,342
Mr. Yamada, we sure find that hard to believe!

468
00:26:19,342 --> 00:26:21,994
And so, who is this person who guided you?

469
00:26:21,994 --> 00:26:26,360
I knew him from an internet message board.

470
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,477
And...

471
00:26:27,477 --> 00:26:31,220
I've actually never seen what he looks like.

472
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,974
That person...

473
00:26:32,974 --> 00:26:35,591
helped out someone named Hermes...

474
00:26:35,591 --> 00:26:38,982
from a drunk man on a train, and because of that...

475
00:26:38,982 --> 00:26:40,402
he falls in love, but...

476
00:26:40,402 --> 00:26:42,415
Is this...  my...?

477
00:26:42,415 --> 00:26:44,126
Your what?

478
00:26:44,126 --> 00:26:47,092
And what is it that you want to tell him

479
00:26:47,092 --> 00:26:50,617
Densha Otoko-san, you...

480
00:26:50,617 --> 00:26:53,445
gave courage to me...

481
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,995
someone who wasn't able to live on her own.

482
00:26:55,995 --> 00:26:56,732
But

483
00:26:56,732 --> 00:26:59,533
You still have some unfinished business left.

484
00:26:59,533 --> 00:27:01,583
Please read the message board.

485
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:04,985
Everyone is looking for you.

486
00:27:04,985 --> 00:27:06,105
Looking...?

487
00:27:06,105 --> 00:27:08,719
Please, read the message board soon!

488
00:27:08,719 --> 00:27:11,187
Densha Otoko...  You mean -that- Densha Otoko?

489
00:27:11,187 --> 00:27:12,731

655
00:37:13,058 --> 00:37:18,724
L...  l...  long time no talk!
<Hi, you've reached Aoyama>

656
00:37:18,724 --> 00:37:21,802
Pl...  pl...  please read the message board!

657
00:37:21,802 --> 00:37:24,830
E...  Everything about me is crammed into that place.

658
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:26,409
P...  P...  Please.

659
00:37:26,409 --> 00:37:28,517
Please read it until the end.

660
00:37:28,517 --> 00:37:30,274
At the very end

661
00:37:30,274 --> 00:37:31,654
I've written a message for...

662
00:37:32,715 --> 00:37:34,956
you, Aoyama-san.

663
00:37:46,403 --> 00:37:48,188
It was a bit different than I expected

664
00:37:48,188 --> 00:37:51,632
but I told her I wanted her to read the message board.

665
00:37:51,632 --> 00:37:55,595
Now, I'm gonna write a message addressed to her.

666
00:37:58,007 --> 00:37:59,992
Dear Hermes-san,

667
00:37:59,992 --> 00:38:01,642
After reading this message board

668
00:38:01,642 --> 00:38:05,316
I'm sure you're surprised, in many different ways.

669
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:07,710
For me, I'm feel embarrassed...

670
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,194
Nostalgic...

671
00:38:09,194 --> 00:38:11,097
And a little funny.

672
00:38:11,097 --> 00:38:12,419
But...

673
00:38:12,419 --> 00:38:13,721
There are no lies or tricks

674
00:38:13,721 --> 00:38:15,979
in the words you see here.

675
00:38:15,979 --> 00:38:17,153
That...

676
00:38:17,153 --> 00:38:19,456
is something that's true for the guys on the internet

677
00:38:19,456 --> 00:38:21,655
I don't know their names or faces

678
00:38:21,655 --> 00:38:22,731
but they...

679
00:38:22,731 --> 00:38:23,931
For me...

680
00:38:23,931 --> 00:38:26,866
are truly my friends.

681
00:38:26,866 --> 00:38:27,912
If there's one thing

682
00:38:27,912 --> 00:38:30,283
that I could be proud of...

683
00:38:30,283 --> 00:38:32,064
it's that I was able to meet them.

684
00:38:32,064 --> 00:38:34,567
I can say that without a doubt.

685
00:38:34,567 --> 00:38:36,237
It was because of those guys

686
00:38:36,237 --> 00:38:37,132
that I...

687
00:38:37,132 --> 00:38:39,350
never gave up on you.

688
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,003
It's because of those guys

689
00:38:41,003 --> 00:38:42,176
that I...

690
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:45,771
was able to make up my mind and tell you how I feel.

691
00:38:45,771 --> 00:38:46,982
Tomorrow...

692
00:38:46,982 --> 00:38:49,968
I'll be waiting for you at our secret spot.

693
00:38:49,968 --> 00:38:53,472
I'll wait until you show up.

694
00:38:53,472 --> 00:38:55,893
Finally...

695
00:38:55,893 --> 00:38:58,235
About having written here without your permission...

696
00:38:58,235 --> 00:39:00,798
and in doing so, having hurt you...

697
00:39:00,798 --> 00:39:06,477
...please forgive me.

698
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:08,706
Densha Otoko.

699
00:39:40,122 --> 00:39:41,115
Now...

700
00:39:41,115 --> 00:39:42,216
I'm leaving home.

701
00:39:42,216 --> 00:39:43,954
It's the final match...  Do your best!

702
00:39:43,954 --> 00:39:46,557
Go Densha!  Hit her with everything you've got!

703
00:39:46,557 --> 00:39:48,815
Densha, go now!  I'll make sure you won't leave any regrets!

704
00:39:48,815 --> 00:39:49,945
Even if Hermes doesn't work out...

705
00:39:49,945 --> 00:39:51,830
you won't be one of these bitter, single guys again.

706
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:54,179
You're shining so brightly, Densha!

707
00:39:54,179 --> 00:39:55,730
We'll wait for you at the last stop.

708
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:57,992
Who cares about the results?

709
00:39:57,992 --> 00:40:01,565
If you tell her how you feel, that's good enough for me!

710
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,346
Okay, I guess I should wear an air raid helmet just in case.

711
00:40:03,346 --> 00:40:05,292
Venoa~

712
00:40:05,292 --> 00:40:07,502
So this day has finally arrived!  It took long enough...

713
00:40:07,502 --> 00:40:09,781
I'll look back on those days we smiled and cried with Densha...

714
00:40:09,781 --> 00:40:11,831
I guess people can change in 3 months.

715
00:40:11,831 --> 00:40:14,458
I'll give you my energy, if you're okay with how weak it is.

716
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:17,271
Um excuse me, I'm already crying here...

717
00:40:17,271 --> 00:40:18,598
I'm not gonna cry yet...

718
00:40:18,598 --> 00:40:21,160
but I'll wail after Densha comes back!

719
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,353
Densha

720
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:23,235
We aren't just...

721
00:40:23,235 --> 00:40:25,564
connected by some telephone wires.

722
00:40:25,564 --> 00:40:33,989
We're connected with our hearts.

723
00:40:33,989 --> 00:40:35,331
Guys

724
00:40:35,331 --> 00:40:36,868
Thanks so much

725
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:39,887
For these three months.

726
00:40:39,887 --> 00:40:40,944
To get here...

727
00:40:40,944 --> 00:40:42,457
it's felt like an eternity...

728
00:40:42,457 --> 00:40:44,117
and at the same time like a heartbeat

729
00:40:44,117 --> 00:40:46,425
It's a strange feeling - I'm not even sure

730
00:40:46,425 --> 00:40:48,537
if it's a dream or reality.

731
00:40:48,537 --> 00:40:50,346
Honestly...

732
00:40:50,346 --> 00:40:54,334
I'm more nervous than anything.

733
00:40:54,334 --> 00:40:55,894
But...

734
00:40:55,894 --> 00:40:57,037
I'll do...

735
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:59,752
What I have to do.

736
00:40:59,752 --> 00:41:02,260
Today...

737
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,928
will probably be the day...

738
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:10,218
that's a turning point in my life.

739
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:11,250
I'll fly out

740
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:12,996
from this sheltered life

741
00:41:12,996 --> 00:41:15,824
I've been living up until now.

742
00:41:15,824 --> 00:41:17,270
And...

743
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:19,203
I've taken in

744
00:41:19,203 --> 00:41:21,613
Everyone's hopes and wishes.

745
00:41:21,613 --> 00:41:23,799
I won't return without completing this.

[The world is here for the two of you!]

747
00:42:04,069 --> 00:42:05,536
Well then...

748
00:42:05,536 --> 00:42:09,238
I'll be on my way.

749
00:42:40,215 --> 00:42:42,077
Going anywhere?

750
00:42:42,077 --> 00:42:46,206
I have to start my new life, right?

751
00:42:46,206 --> 00:42:51,364
Now that I'm divorced, I feel so much lighter and I can see everything clearly now!

752
00:42:51,364 --> 00:42:53,256
You never said that before.

753
00:42:53,256 --> 00:42:57,077
I guess that's thanks to Yamada-san.

You did well, Densha.

00:43:49,157 --> 00:43:51,367
Sorry, but you were a little too late.

*1) Chuubou, written as 'kitchen' is 'middle school boy' in 2ch lingo.  'Chuugakusei no bouya' or 'Chuugakusei no bouzu'

*2) "Maman" is a phrase used by Jonathan from Yoshiyuki Tomino's "Brain Powered."  It's one of his more recent works, but probably not one of his better ones.
