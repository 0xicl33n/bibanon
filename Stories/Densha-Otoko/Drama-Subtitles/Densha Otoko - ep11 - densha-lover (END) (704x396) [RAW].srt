1
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,410
P-p-please take a look at the board.

2
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,440
My whole life is written there.

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,140
P-p-please.  Read it to the end.

4
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,750
At the end, you'll see a message...

5
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,690
Today, on my way home after an Akiba event..

6
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,830
an old drunk on the train was harrassing people.

7
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:56,330
I worked up some courage, and called out to him..

8
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:57,410
S-stop!

9
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,800
Huh?

10
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,780
I s-said s-stop!

11
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,250
I'm sure my voice was shaking..

12
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,860
I'd never been in a fight before..

13
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,730
Are you all right?

14
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,910
I was so lame..

15
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,450
Guys! What should I do?

16
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,690
The young lady on the train..

17
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,240
sent me a letter and
some cups as a "thank-you"..

18
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:38,310
How did she write the letter?
Is there hope for you?

19
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:42,940
"I was moved by your courage on the train."

20
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,670
This sounds too good to be true.

21
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,970
Aren't you just deluding yourself here?

22
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,280
Don't take this guy seriously.

23
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,090
H-h-her cell phone number!

24
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,540
Call her now!

25
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,120
I can't, I can't, I can't!

26
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,490
Start by picking up your phone...

27
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,640
I've got her number, but I can't dial it!

28
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,240
I need more courage for this
than I needed on the train!

29
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,190
My hands are shaking, my face is hot,
my heart is pounding like crazy..

30
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,200
Damn, even I'm getting nervous here!

31
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,200
Don't be fooled.  This guy is playing you..

32
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,710
One thing you should remember.
The girl you like is alone, but..

33
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,200
you have all of us supporting you.

34
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,350
Thank you all.  I'm getting choked up here.

35
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:26,950
You're so kind, and I'm so lame..
I..want to change!

36
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,340
By the way, do you know
what brand the cups are?

37
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:36,300
It says "H E R M E S"..

38
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,550
Hey, that's "Erumesu!"

39
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,650
"Erumesu!" Yes!

40
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:43,770
It's pronounced "E ru me su"!

41
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,510
You mean the same brand as the purse?

42
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,620
I think this is more
than a simple "thank you".

43
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,120
Why don't you ask us for advice
while you're on the phone?

44
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,980
It's not like you have anything to lose!

45
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,730
[You can do it!]

46
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,870
Ok, I'm calling her!

47
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:26,100
Yesss!

48
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,310
[You're a man among men!]

49
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,320
[Go for it!]

50
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,320
[You're amazing!]

51
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,200
I just realized something..

52
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,980
I got caught up in the momentum
and made plans with Hermes-san, but..

53
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,590
when she sees what a nerd I am,
she'll completely lose interest..what do I do?

54
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,230
Don't worry..you just need
to take care of your looks.

55
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,790
Get rid of those nerdy Akiba
clothes, and you're fine.

56
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,730
Change your clothes, and
you'll change your attitude.

57
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:55,850
From clothes to talking to her,
we might have to teach him everything.

58
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,490
Alright, let's get him ready then.

59
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:02,050
Densha Otoko Revamping Project

60
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,130
Let's start with his hair.

61
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,790
Forget blonde hair, but get some highlights.

62
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,770
I think you should let the stylists decide.

63
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,330
Want an impact look?
Go for dreads or corn rows!

64
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,670
Come on, cutting it short will
make the best impression.

65
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,750
Aren't you gonna panic when
the sales people talk to you?

66
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,010
If you think of Hermes..

67
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,260
.you can be a better man.

68
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,300
Um..what do you think?

69
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,530
Actually, I hadn't thought that far ahead..

70
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:42,840
.as far as dating her..

71
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:47,620
But..I definitely have feelings for her..

72
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,570
When we meet..
I know I'm going to fall for her..

73
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:59,530
Of course, she might have a boyfriend..
and if I fall for her, I might get hurt..

74
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,280
Oh, I can't take it!

75
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,910
But..

76
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:09,860
for a loser like me..even being able
to imagine myself with her..

77
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:14,660
is amazing. I owe it all to you guys.

78
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,330
Everybody..

79
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,310
Thank you so much.

80
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,760
Thanks..

81
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,760
for thinking of me.

82
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,830
I..

83
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,320
I'll do my best.

84
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,790
I was so nervous..
walking side by side with a woman.

85
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:47,050
Walking the way I normally do..
I leave her behind.

86
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:51,510
And she's even cuter than
she was when we first met!

87
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,670
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:59,700
I couldn't stop thinking..a guy like me and a girl like her
didn't look like we belonged together.

89
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:06,030
She's so much taller than me.
Everyone was probably staring at me.

90
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:19,710
Don't worry.  I'll just hold on to you.

91
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:30,060
I was surprised, and jerked my hand away..

92
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,620
That was your chance!

93
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,730
Hold her hand!

94
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:40,040
I'll just hold on to you.
I'll just hold on to you.
I'll just hold on to you.

95
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,040
I wanted her to hold on..

96
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,560
I mean..I wanted to tell her
I'd rather she held my hand..

97
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,770
Yes.

98
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:07,410
Yamada-shi, did you forget..the special edition
Mina DVD box goes on sale tomorrow?

99
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:12,380
It even has the storyboards for
the legendary episode 7!

100
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,490
I can guarantee they won't last long!

101
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,620
I'm sorry.

102
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,690
I have something more important
to take care of.

103
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,110
I'm really sorry.

104
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:33,640
Actually..because of a misunderstanding..

105
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,190
she thinks I'm a surfer.

106
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,760
Not a problem.

107
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,950
I'll show you how to get good fast.

108
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,100
Just stand on the board,
and it'll work out somehow.

109
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:46,050
Ok, let's Google it, and
see what advice we can give Densha.

110
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,050
Thanks guys.  I'll give it a try.

111
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,180
Who cares if you can't surf.

112
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,080
Just remember..

113
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,400
you lied to her.

114
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:11,080
What's important is that you think
of what's best for her..and make things right.

115
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,260
I'm really sorry..

116
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,830
I..

117
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,960
don't know how to surf.

118
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,270
I..

119
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:22,490
lied..to you.

120
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,700
Lied?

121
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,480
I'm really sorry..

122
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,260
for lying to you.

123
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,140
I don't think..

124
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:40,450
I can just stop being a nerd.
Hiding who I am..is a lie in itself.

125
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,790
Stop analyzing it so much.
Everyone has something to hide.

126
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:47,230
There's no need to hide it.
Being a nerd..is who you are.

127
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,870
She'll see you as being sincere
if you tell her you're a nerd.

128
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,560
Everyone, thank you for your thoughts.

129
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,470
I know it's a crazy gamble..

130
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,190
but I've decided..

131
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,760
I won't lie to her.

132
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,480
I'm..

133
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,400
going to come out and
let her see I'm a nerd!

134
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,520
I'm..

135
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,880
a nerd.

136
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:22,260
I've been called lame and disgusting..

137
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,510
but that can't be helped.

138
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,840
But..

139
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,350
For me..

140
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,770
This is the only way I know how to live.

141
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,060
I..

142
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,060
didn't want to lie to you.

143
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,330
So..

144
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,460
I wanted you to see me..

145
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,740
the way I really am.

146
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,350
[Jinnkama-san]

147
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:15,770
Yes?

148
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,320
Where the hell are you?

149
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,160
Here I am working overtime,
and you don't bother stopping by to say hi?

150
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:23,000
You can still make it.
Get over here.

151
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,210
I'm sorry.  I have something
important to do today.

152
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,970
Huh? Are you actually
talking back to me?

153
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:32,030
Who gave you permission to
put anything ahead of me?

154
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,880
I really can't today.

155
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,690
I have a promise to keep..

156
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,690
the most important promise of my life.

157
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,210
Huh?

158
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,690
I'm really sorry.

159
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,550
That's the first time
he's ever refused me.

160
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,570
On this board..

161
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:01,640
I've told you guys everything
about the two of us..

162
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:05,410
She might see that
as a terrible thing.

163
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,660
But..

164
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:14,880
without you guys, there is no way
we would have gotten together.

165
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:18,370
If I hadn't written you guys about us..

166
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:23,310
I never would have had any self-esteem.

167
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,020
Above all..

168
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:31,240
I wouldn't have met such wonderful friends.

169
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,900
You guys were always..

170
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,240
right there with me..

171
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,390
That's why I was able..

172
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,390
to make it this far.

173
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,390
I'm proud..

174
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,390
of this board.

175
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,980
That's why..

176
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,990
I'm going to go and..

177
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,990
tell her about it.

178
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,410
I want her to understand..

179
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,110
my feelings for her..

180
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,290
and all your kind support.

181
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,630
Dear Hermes-san..

182
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:30,550
I'm sure you were surprised in many ways.. after reading..

183
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,730
the messages on this board.

184
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,010
I myself feel..

185
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:39,240
embarrassed and nostalgic..

186
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,950
It's all so strange.

187
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,930
But..

188
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,810
I don't think you'll find..

189
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,910
any lies here.

190
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,420
And I speak..

191
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,490
for everyone on the Net..

192
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,320
I might not know their names or faces..

193
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,480
but for me..

194
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,910
they are..

195
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,130
true friends.

196
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,480
If there is anything..

197
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,960
I am proud of..

198
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,830
it would be meeting these great people.

199
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,770
Thanks to them..

200
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:23,000
I never gave up on getting together with you.

201
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,550
Thanks to them..

202
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,160
I..

203
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,820
have the courage to tell you how I feel.

204
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,400
Tomorrow..

205
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,820
I'll be waiting for you
at our secret spot.

206
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,740
I'll be there till you come.

207
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,420
Finally..

208
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,660
I'm sorry to have written
about you on this board..

209
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,920
and causing you pain.

210
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,920
Please forgive me.

[Final Episode]

213
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:42,590
Densha, you've really come a long ways..
I'm impressed even as your enemy.

214
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,810
However..

215
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:48,680
you'll find there are some walls
that can't be climbed.

216
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,690
This..is the Final Round.

217
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,200
Yes?

218
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,330
Come quick.  Saori has collapsed.

219
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,590
She's been taken to the hospital nearby.

220
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:07,710
She's calling out your name,  going in
and out of consciousness..Go to her now!

221
00:15:07,711 --> 00:15:09,428
Ok, I'll be right there!

222
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,460
Who was that?

223
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,460
Ok, ok! Come to daddy! Ow, ow, ow!

224
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,310
Here I go!

225
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:28,880
Saori!

226
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,980
Kazuya-san!

227
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,980
In a hurry?  Hop in.

228
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,620
Thank you.

Special Thanks to pocemit, for providing the raw file
Greetings to all the Densha-fansubbers:
Greyhorse, aviness, OTL & masakun.

231
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,500
Hey, hey! Tonight's special guest..

232
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,030
Sambo Master, will play us a new song!

233
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:04,440
It's a song to support Densha Otoko
on that A Channel we've heard so much about.

234
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,390
Ok, Sambo Master, let's hope your song inspires
him with courage, wherever he may be!

235
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,030
I don't know your name..

236
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,670
I don't know your face either..

237
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,960
I don't know what kind of guy you are!

238
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,310
But hey, who cares!

239
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:24,950
The world calls that..love!

240
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:38,310
When I see some light through my tears..

241
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:45,120
I'll tell you the things I've kept to myself

242
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:52,080
If even then our voices go unheard, my brothers..

243
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:59,480
Until morning comes, I at least want to find someone to sing with..

244
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:06,460
If you say that wasn't the real you yesterday..

245
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:12,330
I'll just put it behind us..

246
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:15,850
The ones who decide our new future..

247
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:18,710
Are the new you and me..

248
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:22,730
We'll figure it out somehow..

249
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:26,170
The world calls that love!

250
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,250
The thing that connects our hearts..

251
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,390
I had no idea it would be this scary..

252
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:36,240
You and I, together..

253
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:43,960
Put our past behind us and sing!

254
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:33,290
Hey, Listen to the Japan Broadcast Radio guys!
They're playing a song for Densha!

255
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,350
That's a good song.
I've been crying a lot lately.

256
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,010
I hope Densha and Hermes are listening.

257
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:51,720
It's like the song's encouraging us too.

258
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,490
It's our duty to wait for Densha to come home.

259
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,880
Is it possible she hasn't seen these messages yet?

260
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,510
Of course it's possible.
Normal people wouldn't read them.

261
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,850
If she does read this..
I hope..

262
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:04,000
Hermes, please go to the secret spot!

263
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,350
Stop.

264
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,530
Thank you.

265
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:16,990
Ok, here comes the climax.

266
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,990
Yamada-san.

267
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,600
This is Yamada.

268
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,800
I'm at the hospital Saori was taken to, but
I was told she isn't here.

269
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,200
What?  Wait, wait, this
has to be a mistake.

270
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,410
She just left the house.

271
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,510
Really?

272
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,920
Yeah, she seemed pretty serious,
and left here in a hurry.

273
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,210
In a hurry..

274
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,640
I see.

275
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,070
One thing..

276
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,740
Yes?

277
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,170
I read the board.

278
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,680
What?

279
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,280
Oh.

280
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:34,740
I know now you were
serious about my sister.

281
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:36,970
Yes.

282
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,650
I was wrong to hit you.

283
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:44,940
I think she'll understand too.

284
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,520
Thank you very much.

285
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,520
I have to go.

286
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,970
So this is the secret spot.

287
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,030
I bet Yamada..

288
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,270
didn't think he was good
enough for you..

289
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,870
and ran off.

290
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:13,020
Wait, Saori!

291
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,730
Okay..

292
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:18,690
It's not going exactly
as planned, but..

293
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,330
[Densha Otoko, Come back to the board!]

294

[Densha Otoko, come back to the board!]

295
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,190
- Hello?
- Saori, I found Yamada.

296
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,320
On the platform at the station.
Come quick.

297
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,030
Ok.

298
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,550
Where is he?

299
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,550
Yamada..

300
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:54,660
said he wasn't good enough for you..

301
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,660
and ran off.

302
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,340
Saori..

303
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,630
Marry me.

304
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:20,310
As he was leaving, he said..

305
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:23,320
I'm leaving it to you..

306
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,080
Make Saori happy for me.

307
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:29,300
- Kazuya-san...
- Saori...

308
00:22:34,814 --> 00:22:37,902
- Freak!
- Pardon me..

309
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,410
Saori!

310
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:57,030
Yamada..

311
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,350
said he wasn't good enough
for you and ran off.

312
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,720
Saori..

313
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,460
Marry me.

314
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,840
Aoyama-san...

315
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,210
Kazuya-san..

316
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:35,900
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.

317
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:38,180
Yamada..

318
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:41,660
you take it from here.
Make Saori happy.

319
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:47,310
I should have just
taken off with her..

320
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:46,870
This is the real thing!

321
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,870
Are you serious?  Oh my god!

322
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,498
It's so hard!

323
00:23:50,498 --> 00:23:51,270
Wait a sec...

324
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,040
I remember you two!

325
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,490
Oh crap!

326
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:56,710
That ring!

327
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,030
- Sorry, sorry.
- Watch where you're going!

328
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,730
It's an emergency.  Sorry!

329
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,190
That old dude is running!

330
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:06,210
I'm not an "old dude"!

331
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:09,430
Hey, that's my Lanevo!

332
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,430
Damn it!

333
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:14,100
I'll get you with my Lanevo 2!

334
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:24,680
What are you doing!
Where are you taking it!

335
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,050
My ring! My cars!

336
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,350
Hermes!

337
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:33,310
Come back!

338
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,100
Um..

339
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,500
We meet..

340
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,460
at last..

341
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,700
Densha Otoko-san.

342
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:01,290
Densha, where are you?

343
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:10,280
I've been glued to the board since last
night, and haven't slept a wink.

344
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,160
You guys awake?

345
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,560
Yeah..

346
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,090
I'm nodding off, but this is for Densha.
I'll wait for him.

347
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:22,420
Sleepy..sleepy..

348
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,770
I can't. Night.

349
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:31,990
My heroes are dropping off like flies..I've tried, but
much to my chagrin, I can't stay awake..

350
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:37,420
I'm trying to stay awake
to welcome him back for the last time.

351
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,770
Oh, I'm dead.

352
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,990
I'm back.

353
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,580
Densha, is that you?

354
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:53,750
He's back!

355
00:25:55,140 --> 00:26:00,520
It's going to take hours to finish
writing everything..so sleepy..

356
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,900
We know you're sleepy, but
we're dying to know!!

357
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:07,010
We've been killing time for
half a day waiting for you!

358
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:09,490
I take the prize with
15 hours!

359
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,980
Sorry to make you wait.
Can I start with the outcome?

360
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,790
No, no, keep that for the end.

361
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:18,150
Tease us with it, nice and slow.

362
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,020
Announce the outcome at the last stop!

363
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,620
All right guys, let's
go out with a bang!

364
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,870
My heart is beating
out of control!

365
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:26,050
My whole desk is shaking!

366
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:31,370
Here comes the biggest bomb this
thread has ever seen, one that will make history!

367
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,080
Ok, here I go.

368
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:38,460
As promised, I was at our
secret spot the whole time..

369
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,550
picturing myself telling her how I feel.

370
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:45,180
Then some guy called and told
me Hermes had collapsed.

371
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:51,230
That turned out to be untrue, so
I hurried back to our spot.

372
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:56,700
And then, I saw her
there at the station.

373
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,660
How dramatic!

374
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,650
It's like you two were
meant to be together.

375
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:02,760
What a perfect setup!

376
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,870
We have to thank the guy that
gave you the false info. Good job!

377
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,490
You're welcome.

378
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,430
We decided to go back
to our secret spot.

379
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,230
For a while..

380
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,350
Hermes didn't say anything.

381
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,800
Of course, I didn't either.

382
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,720
And then..

383
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,720
she broke the silence.

384
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,250
I read..

385
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,650
the message board.

386
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:28,900
I see.

387
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:33,240
After reading it..

388
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:40,850
I came to understand how you
depended on those people..

389
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:43,760
and then..

390
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:49,810
I found out how you
feel about me.

391
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,550
It made me happy.

392
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,940
What?

393
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:11,560
I was so happy to find out..

394
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,680
you felt that way about me.

395
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,530
The people on the message board..

396
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:23,530
are very kind, aren't they?

397
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,490
Yes.

398
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,100
That's why..

399
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,470
I came here so you could tell me..

400
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:48,850
how you feel in person.

401
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,950
So..

402
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,580
will you please tell me?

403
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,190
Yes.

404
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,440
Yes, yes yes!

405
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,510
Hermes, MOE!

406
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:24,620
So, does that mean THIS IS IT?

407
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,010
It's time to confess!

408
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:28,180
The train is on the move!

409
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:32,080
There's no protecting ourselves from this bomb..

410
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,220
This reminds me of the first time
I completed an RPG game..

411
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:42,470
This might just be the end of me, guys.
So let me say it.  I love you guys!

412
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,540
I'm going to run through the
city without any clothes!

413
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:47,320
I'm so pumped up,
I have no words asdlkajfal..

414
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,270
Bring it on!!

415
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,320
For a while..

416
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,260
neither of us said a word.

417
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:58,080
I..

418
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,080
was so nervous..

419
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,080
I couldn't say anything.

420
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:15,230
I..I have..

421
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,230
something important to say.

422
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:19,120
Yes.

423
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,560
When I'm with you..

424
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:35,740
my whole world brightens up.

425
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,780
All of..

426
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,870
t-the..

427
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,500
time I spent aimlessly..

428
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:47,860
and the same old scenery..

429
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:51,550
and even..

430
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:54,010
my own deplorable self..

431
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,170
Like magic..

432
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:58,170
everything..

433
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:00,540
has brightened up for me.

434
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,830
Aoyama-san..

435
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,780
it's because..

436
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,660
you've shined your light on me.

437
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,680
You've given me..

438
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,940
so much..

439
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,240
in my life..

440
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,200
But..

441
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:34,400
I..

442
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,430
have nothing to give you.

443
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,380
I can't do anything for you.

444
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,600
But..

445
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:51,560
But..

446
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:56,990
when it comes to..

447
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,790
my feelings for you..

448
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,110
No one's..

449
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,060
No one's..feelings are stronger.

450
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,660
I..

451
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:28,340
I..

452
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,620
You can do it.

453
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:03,940
I..

454
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,920
I..

455
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,590
Aoyama-san, I..

456
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,290
really like you!

457
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,770
Yamada-san..

458
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,710
I..

459
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:44,330
like you too.

460
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,270
So..

461
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,130
From now on..

462
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:00,090
will you be with me always?

463
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,770
Yes.

464
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:15,590
YES!!!!

465
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:18,290
Thank you.

466
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,830
Always..

467
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,820
Always..

468
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:27,790
please be with me..

469
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:29,930
Ok.

470
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,310
Sorry.

471
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:38,170
I..

472
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,810
really..Aoyama-san..

473
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,630
I'm sorry.

474
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:01,110
I've never been treated kindly..

475
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,630
by a woman.

476
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:18,670
Now..

477
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,530
I've started crying.

478
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:47,255
She kissed you!!

479
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,910
After telling you I liked you..

480
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:00,620
I've fallen for you even more..

481
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:16,910
Enough! I have no regrets in my life!

482
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,820
Now I've started crying..

483
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,820
I'm crying already..

484
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:25,740
My tears are shining like pearls.

485
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:28,730
I'm going to get dehydrated
from all this crying!

486
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:31,820
I hope my dad doesn't come in
and see me like this!

487
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:38,120
Spring has come.
Spring has come.
Where has it come?

488
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:45,220
It's come for Densha.
It's come for Hermes.
Benoist to all us losers!

489
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:51,320
Densha, congratulations.  And to all you guys on
this thread, you're the best.  We did it!

490
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,860
Did you make love to her?  Did you do it?

491
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,590
Densha, you're the MVP this year.

492
00:36:55,590 --> 00:37:01,080
Your hobbies don't matter anymore. The only
thing that matters is that the two of you are in love.

493
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:07,260
Who cares if you're a nerd, or used to be one of us.
Make her happy, and be happy yourself!

494
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,600
I'm really crying now!

495
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:17,010
Me too.  I think your uncertainty and trials will turn out for
the best now.  You can make her even happier.

496
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:21,080
Remembering what happened
is getting me choked up again.

497
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:24,010
Don't worry, I'm sure I've cried
twice as much as you.

498
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:26,050
I've never cried this much just
listening to someone's story..

499
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:29,070
There's stuff coming out of my eyes..
but I have no one to wipe it for me.

500
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:33,280
Are there really angels like her in Tokyo?
Is this the Japanese dream?

501
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,850
A girl who's cute and innocent?
A girl who'll take care of you?

502
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:41,910
Where are they? Where are they?
Save one for me! I bet she's the last one!

503
00:37:42,975 --> 00:37:44,641
Here it is, the ultimate weapon!

504
00:37:44,642 --> 00:37:45,642
Wait, no one's there!

505
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:49,340
My god, am I still alive?

506
00:37:49,341 --> 00:37:50,341
Magic!

507
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,920
You're really cool! Congratulations!

508
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,400
So where's your wedding going to be at?

509
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,080
Densha, do you have anything left to report?

510
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:06,350
Yes, but it's Mina-time now.
I'll finish up later.

511
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:08,450
You're making us wait for a cartoon!

512
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:11,290
Oh, don't do this to us now!

513
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:13,990
Oh, that's so you.
You really are an anime freak!

514
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:15,440
Hey, what is Mina?

515
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,970
"Lunar Bunny Weapon Mina"
Look it up.

516
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:22,550
I can't help it.  I really love you!

517
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:34,900
I can't believe I led her right to him.
That bastard Anime Freak Densha.

518
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:39,690
God, you'd think he'd put himself in our shoes!
Teasing us like that.

519
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:42,360
Next time I see him,
I'll beat his face in!

520
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,560
Ah, I wonder what it's like..

521
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,200
A love meant to be..
destiny..

522
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,720
Stop playing with your cell phone.

523
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:59,350
Why don't you play with this instead?

524
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:05,640
A guy like you?  Not a chance!

525
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:09,270
Stop!  She doesn't
like it, can't you see?

526
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,360
Hey! She was hitting ME!

527
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,170
You ok?

528
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:25,350
Thank you so much.

529
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:26,410
I've seen you before.

530
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,850
I thought so too!

531
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:29,350
Could this be..

532
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:30,990
destiny?

533
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:37,710
I couldn't focus at all..

534
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:55,490
She and I wandered
around for a bit.

535
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,410
After a while, we
came to a park.

536
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:04,430
And then, we sat on
an empty bench, but..

537
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:08,730
had there ever been a time that
we were so close to one another?

538
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:12,340
I doubt it.

539
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:15,660
Watch out!  Here comes another one!

540
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,950
Out of the blue, here it comes!

541
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:21,240
It's like a sudden attack
during a cease-fire!

542
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,680
And he's so nonchalant about it too.
I love you Densha!

543
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:32,520
I got this for you when
I went to Italy on business.

544
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,070
Open it please.

545
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:40,070
Ok.

546
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:52,130
This looks very expensive.

547
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:54,330
Not really.

548
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,960
It's very nice.  I really appreciate it.

549
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:05,410
Thank you very much.

550
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:08,600
Not at all.  Please try it on.

551
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,700
Ok.

552
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,050
Thank you.

553
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:32,950
It looks good on you.

554
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,170
Thank you.

555
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,340
It matches mine.

556
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,860
Guys?

557
00:41:55,860 --> 00:42:01,510
No response?  Like "It matches!" or
"You got a souvenir!"

558
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,080
To be honest, I never imagined
anything like this, so..

559
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,860
We can't keep up with you now..

560
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,690
The enemy is just too strong..

561
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:12,190
I'm starting to get annoyed..

562
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:14,190
Does this kind of thing happen in real life?

563
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:16,730
Well, not in my life.

564
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:24,540
Gradually, we settled down, and started to talk
about things that we hadn't been able to before.

565
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,470
Like how we became
attracted to each other..

566
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:31,470
What we was going on in our minds..

567
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:36,960
We never seemed to run
out of things to say..

568
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:42,400
Then I noticed
something was not right.

569
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:46,680
I lost one of my contact lenses.

570
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:47,970
Really?

571
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:53,680
Something's been bothering
me..that must be it.

572
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:56,080
So let's go look for it.

573
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:01,680
Oh, it's just a disposable,
don't worry about it.

574
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,960
Really?

575
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,260
Yes.

576
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:19,060
I can't see anything now.

577
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:24,770
Not even my face?

578
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,920
Actually, I could see it,
but I said..

579
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:30,630
No..

580
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:36,850
How about now?

581
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:44,770
Oh, you sly dog!

582
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:47,990
Hermes-san, he's lying to you!!

583
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:52,360
Another bomb! You trying to kill us?

584
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,754
Hold on guys! Am I the only one
that has a bad feeling about this?

585
00:43:55,754 --> 00:43:59,595
We're not gonna make it
through this attack!

586
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:03,270
Here it comes! Retreat! Retreat!

587
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:08,220
This time, it's your turn.

588
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:10,670
Ok.

589
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:21,720
Not there.

590
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,580
Here.

591
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:41,040
It was maybe 2 or 3 seconds.

592
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:47,430
I had no idea anything so
soft existed in the world.

593
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:53,620
It was the first time I'd
seen her face up close.

594
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:56,560
I saw myself..

595
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,900
reflected in her eyes.

596
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:09,700
That's the one!!

597
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:13,260
Oh, this is too much! I'm dead!

598
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:16,990
Goodbye!

599
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:18,670
I can't take it.

600
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:21,840
After that, she..

601
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:25,670
she whispered into my ear..

602
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:30,780
that she was in love with me..
and kissed me again.

603
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:34,550
My image of Hermes is falling apart!

604
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:36,860
"in love with me.."

605
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:44,340
We kissed again and again..

606
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:49,050
and finally..we even kissed like adults!

607
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,860
Wait, wait..what do you mean
by "kissed like adults"?

608
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:00,890
Look out! Friendly fire!

609
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,290
That's all.

610
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:08,900
Guys, thank you.  I'm going
to sleep now.  Bye.

611
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:36,320
Hey, take it easy!

612
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,310
What do you mean you can't date me?

613
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:39,330
Well..

614
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:40,970
Be a man, and say it!

615
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:43,960
Well, your ankles are not a turn-on and..

616
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,080
Huh?

617
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,370
They just aren't my type!

618
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,130
Are you saying my legs are fat?

619
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:51,840
Yeah..

620
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:55,632
Normally, I'd never take a
second look at a guy like you..

621
00:46:55,632 --> 00:46:58,690
I can't believe it's come to this..

622
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,710
Sorry to call you here like this..

623
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:05,710
Not at all.  Actually..

624
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:09,090
I wanted to say something first..

625
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:11,090
I'm sorry.

626
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:16,310
I'm sorry for not listening to
you and being so pushy.

627
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:20,070
And making it out to be
like I was protecting you..

628
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:22,720
But that wasn't the case.

629
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:28,430
I was the one who was afraid of love,
and I forgot what was really important.

630
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:31,170
No, that's not true.

631
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:34,340
It's because you were thinking of me..

632
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:37,740
that I was able to get back
together with Yamada-san.

633
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,250
Really?

634
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:43,770
I was going to tell you, but you
probably know the whole story already..

635
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,690
Congratulations..

636
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:49,410
Hermes-san.

637
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:56,650
Tsuyoshi, don't leave
your figures here..

638
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:00,960
Tsuyoshi, sit
down right now!

639
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:02,960
Mathilda-san!

640
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:05,820
What are you talking about?

641
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:08,310
Oh, hi Mom. You sound just like her!
(Tsuyoshi's mom is Toda Keiko, Mathilda's voice!)

642
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:10,310
I have something to say.  Sit down.
(Tsuyoshi's mom is Toda Keiko, Mathilda's voice!)

643
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:17,320
Actually, mom's pregnant.

644
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:18,730
That's right!

645
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,590
Congratulations!

646
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:21,800
How did that happen?

647
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,840
On our once-a-month sleepover..right?

648
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,990
Yeah..I really went all out.

649
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:29,990
At your age..

650
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,085
Watch that tone..

651
00:48:31,085 --> 00:48:33,256
What should we call her?

652
00:48:33,256 --> 00:48:35,640
Oh it's a little early for that..

653
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:38,770
I was just thinking..
if it's a girl..

654
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:40,770
how about Mathilda?

655
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:42,110
That's perfect!

656
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:44,530
I like it!

657
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:46,830
How would you write that
in Chinese characters?

658
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:56,420
I'm sorry..I'm a little late..

659
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:03,620
Hermes just mailed me saying she wished
every day was Sunday. I'm so happy!

660
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:05,620
Sorry, but take that to the Couples Board.

661
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:07,480
You're finished here.

662
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:10,680
We don't have time to
listen to your bragging.

663
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:13,800
You'll need to leave before this
thread gets 1000 responses.

664
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:17,900
Is it my imagination, or
is everyone being cold?

665
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:24,030
Densha, listen up.  You aren't a single loser anymore.
In other words, it's time for you to graduate and move on.

666
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:26,940
We've decided not to
watch over you anymore.

667
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:29,250
I know it's hard,
but it's time to say goodbye.

668
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:34,920
But I don't want to say goodbye.  I'll drop in
every once in awhile.

669
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:38,590
So please don't be so cold.

670
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:40,030
Stop your whining.

671
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:42,160
If you stay here,
you'll be a nuisance.

672
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:46,840
This thread is only for single losers.
You don't belong here anymore.

673
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:54,140
But why?  Aren't we friends?

674
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:59,030
I'm going to miss all of you.

675
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:01,680
We are friends..don't you get it?

676
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,690
It's time for you to take the next step.

677
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:05,100
You're not alone anymore!

678
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:09,070
Be strong! If you can't
protect Hermes, who can?

679
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,650
Ok.

680
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,880
I'm moving on.

681
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:04,040
Glad to hear it.

682
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:06,050
I'm sure you'll be fine.

683
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:08,650
We've got 300 responses
to send you off with.

684
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:14,360
Ok, this is it everyone.
Densha's graduation!

685
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,263
Densha, I've realized something watching you.

686
00:51:18,263 --> 00:51:20,375
I can't just be a fan.

687
00:51:20,375 --> 00:51:23,847
I'm going to hit the field, and
have a relationship everyone will envy.

688
00:51:23,948 --> 00:51:26,764
All you guys..Benoist!!

689
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:31,297
I always thought "Hermes MOE~" but this time
you're the one who impressed me, Densha..

690
00:51:31,297 --> 00:51:33,060
but I'm not going to lose to you..

691
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:36,743
I'm done with loose socks..time
to switch to a pantyhose fetish!

692
00:51:36,955 --> 00:51:38,990
Last stop, last stop.

693
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:43,183
I wish you guys all the best.
I'm going to keep at it with my regular job.

694
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:48,933
The train bound for happiness
leaves from platform 2.

695
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:52,020
We only have 200 responses left.

696
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,883
Densha, you taught us that
men are more than their looks..

697
00:51:58,883 --> 00:52:02,552
You're the real deal.  Ok, just testing.

698
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:04,480
Thank you.

699
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,721
Densha and Hermes' jumbo jet took off..

700
00:52:07,721 --> 00:52:11,099
because you guys were there
to refuel and maintain it..

701
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:14,097
I'm so glad I found you
guys on this thread.

702
00:52:14,515 --> 00:52:17,012
I liked the frank and honest
way you came across..

703
00:52:17,013 --> 00:52:18,013
and rooted for you.

704
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,760
Young man, live
your life to its fullest!

705
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:25,330
Even a guy like me could
protect Hermes from a drunk..

706
00:52:25,330 --> 00:52:28,780
but you're the only one for Hermes!

707
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:33,840
This is no "miracle". You won
her over with your own strength!

708
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:37,309
Hurry up and get yourself
to the Couples board.

709
00:52:37,309 --> 00:52:42,821
I'll have the most encouragement if you
never have to come back here again.

710
00:52:42,821 --> 00:52:45,940
I know that sounds corny.

711
00:52:46,021 --> 00:52:52,940
I hate you Densha! And..for wishing you
both happiness.I hate myself more!

712
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:55,470
Damn! We're down to
100 responses. It's too early!

713
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:58,610
I think everyone wants
to thank you, Densha.

714
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:01,280
This is your last chance, guys!

715
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,375
Good job, Densha.
I dropped my studies to root for you..

716
00:53:04,375 --> 00:53:06,584
which sucks when I think about myself now..

717
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:11,257
but when I think about these three months..
I'm sure I got something important in return.

718
00:53:11,257 --> 00:53:16,849
I'll definitely pass my exams and enjoy
life on campus now.  I love all you guys!

719
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:23,970
Me too.  I love all you guys!

720
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:27,110
I've been called a
freeloader and a slacker.

721
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:30,760
This is the first time I've
gone all out for anything.

722
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:34,850
Densha, as your legend grew,
I know I was at least a part of it.

723
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:38,520
That might be going overboard,
but I'll leave it at that.

724
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:44,220
These 3 months I've spent
with you guys..It's been a blast!

725
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:45,426
Everyone put down your weapons!

726
00:53:45,426 --> 00:53:49,394
The Communications Op of the 8th Infantry
Unit will now return to camp.

727
00:53:49,395 --> 00:53:53,425
I'd like to express my happiness to all
for getting back safe and sound.

728
00:53:54,127 --> 00:53:56,100
Densha, I salute you!

729
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:02,590
Densha, I'll see you
again on this thread.

730
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:07,980
Only this time, you'll be helping someone
else out who will be as lost as you were..

731
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:12,600
I'm not saying goodbye.  So long..
and the same with all you guys!

732
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:16,500
I really like how you come across.

733
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:24,120
The fact that you're so pure.  And above all,
the way you feel about Hermes..

734
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:32,390
I might not be like you, but
I'm going to take care of my girl too.

735
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:38,580
Densha, after getting to know you, I realized
there is more to guys than just looks.

736
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:42,908
My guy is no model, but he's very kind.

737
00:54:42,908 --> 00:54:46,512
I realized that when we
were cheering you on.

738
00:54:46,512 --> 00:54:48,950
I appreciate you showing me that.

739
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:53,870
I should be the
one thanking you.

740
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:59,827
With a tiny spark and great courage..
and maybe some butting into your personal life..

741
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:05,870
in addition to your effort and growth..
we've witnessed a miracle.

742
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:08,590
You be sure and take care of her.

743
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:15,034
Thanks to you, Densha..I've gotten back
in a relationship I had almost given up on.

744
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:17,457
Thank you for everything.

745
00:55:17,592 --> 00:55:20,060
I guess it's time to say goodbye.

746
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:25,190
I guess while I was rooting for you,
I kind of fell for you too.

747
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:28,170
Enough to take away your virginity.

748
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:34,200
I want details on your future
with Hermes.

749
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:39,700
I'm going to miss you.
I hope we can meet somewhere.

750
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:42,750
Looking forward to a new day!  Bye!

751
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:48,170
While watching over your relationship,
a lot of things have happened in my life.

752
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:55,630
The biggest thing was getting married.
Thanks to you, my marriage is even stronger.

753
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,370
I really want to thank you.
I'm so proud to have met you.

754
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:02,810
All you guys..

755
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:06,690
I'm so..

756
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:07,930
proud of you too.

757
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:11,960
When I first saw your announcement,
I was very glad to have started this thread.

758
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:16,300
Not necessarily just because you were
the first we helped to get in a relationship..

759
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:20,660
I think you've brought a smile
to the faces of many people here.

760
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,810
Densha..

761
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:25,030
You guys..

762
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:27,950
Good job.

763
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,970
These 3 months have been great.

764
00:56:31,970 --> 00:56:36,147
The time I spent here felt more real
than in my everyday life.

765
00:56:36,147 --> 00:56:43,280
As time passes, memories fade..
and this thread will disappear one day.

766
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:47,020
I don't want to forget what happened here.

767
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:50,280
Real life is full of hassles..

768
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:52,738
but it looks like there are
a few good things too.

769
00:56:52,738 --> 00:56:55,840
The time I spent with you
allowed me to realize that.

770
00:56:55,840 --> 00:57:01,800
One day, I hope to see what you see..
I'll just do it at my own pace.

771
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:06,720
Meanwhile, enjoy yourself
in the couples forum!

772
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:20,560
I was gone for awhile..but somehow
I was able to see you make it in the end..

773
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:27,830
You were completely lost, but thanks to the advice
on this forum, you've become a great man.

774
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:29,900
Densha..

775
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,634
don't you ever let go of her hand..

776
00:57:31,634 --> 00:57:33,610
no matter what happens.

777
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:37,610
You're going to have many experiences now..

778
00:57:37,610 --> 00:57:41,140
When things are going badly..
think back on this board.

779
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:44,270
What you've accomplished..
What you've been told..

780
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:48,660
And finally..what feelings you had
that drove you to get together with Hermes.

781
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:51,850
I pray for your happiness.

782
00:57:52,530 --> 00:57:57,310
And to all you guys..for these
precious moments..

783
00:57:57,450 --> 00:58:01,550
Thank you..I can't..damn!

784
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:05,680
I can't stop crying!

785
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:20,270
I really want to thank you guys.

786
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:26,080
I'm so happy..you've given me courage..
I appreciate everything..

787
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:31,140
I'm overwhelmed with different feelings..

788
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:34,530
I..

789
00:58:35,610 --> 00:58:38,630
won't forget you guys.

790
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:44,380
You guys..

791
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:45,680
I love you all!

792
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:50,400
Me too!

793
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,070
I'm glad there are no hard feelings..

794
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:56,530
I'm crying more here than
I would at a real graduation!

795
00:58:56,530 --> 00:58:59,190
50 left..Everyone prepare yourselves!

796
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:01,748
So this is the last
thread for Densha..

797
00:59:01,748 --> 00:59:05,580
Oh, this hurts..it really hurts..

798
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:07,650
What are we supposed
to do tomorrow?

799
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:11,190
If you get married, let us know.
We wish you eternal happiness.

800
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:15,310
Stop writing, guys..that way Densha

At least we won't have to listen to
what a great thing you guys have going..

803
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:26,740
965.  In the end, you were our inspiration..

804
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:33,380
966.  Densha, I love you!  Don't go!

805
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:37,080
967.  It's almost over!

806
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:42,540
968.  So this is it..it's just not right!

807
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:50,010
969. Why do I cry so much
for someone I've never seen!

808
00:59:50,010 --> 00:59:55,070

are about to begin..

809
00:59:55,070 --> 01:00:02,080
971.  Your feelings for Densha make me cry too.
Densha is a lucky man.

810
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:07,690
972.  Densha, you do response #1000.

811
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:18,190
980.  Is that ok?  What should I write..

812
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:24,850

with #1000!

813
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:31,390

I've decided what to write.

01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:43,680
It's been on my mind for a long time.

817
01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:48,120

818
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:53,940
987.  That's because after we read it,
we won't see you again!

819
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:58,020
990.  Farewell, my friends..

I'd confess my love for her.
