1
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:10,780
Kibonnu-Back in Japan.

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,630
I'm going to Akiba with Hermes!

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,100
What?

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,010
By Akiba, do you mean that fortress of nerds called Akihabara?

5
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,230
Nerds like this?

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,540
And that?

7
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,760
And that?

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,120
THAT Akihabara?

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,950
Isn't that going too far with your coming out?

10
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,500
Details, please...In Japan!

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,330
Let me just give you a quick rundown of my phone conversation with her...

12
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,160
No, no, take your time!

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,830
For us, any exchange with girls is all so new!

14
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:43,020
Please, tease us with it, nice and slow...

15
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,800
Ok then.  I'll tell you the whole story...

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,960
Do you remember your promise?

17
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,510
My promise?

18
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,040
Oh, you've forgotten.

19
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,290
Um...uh...

20
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,810
The com-pu-ter

21
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,400
Oh!

22
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,730
You've forgotten.

23
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,060
I'm sorry!

24
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:08,360
That's ok, but please help me pick one out next time.

25
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:10,910
Sure!

26
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,360
How did you switch to happy mode all of a sudden?

27
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,550
She's so cute, I can't help myself.

28
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,050
I can't believe I was the one telling you to go for it!

29
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,410
Troops!  Troops!

30
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,100
My heart is pounding!

31
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,900
How do you plan to use your computer?

32
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,340
If I can use it for the Internet and E-mail, that's enough for me.

33
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,900
Then it's important for it to be easy to use.

34
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,310
Where do you usually go to buy a computer?

35
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,980
I usually go to Akiba-

36
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,420
Akihabara, that is-

37
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,030
Ok, then let's go there.

38
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,110
Oh but you don't have to go all that way-

39
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,390
I'd like to go where you always go.

40
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,770
I'd like to...get to know you better.

41
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,320
There's the bomb!  There's still time!  Run for shelter!

42
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,010
It's getting late, I'm logging!

43
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:05,540
This is the kind of conversation I dream about all day!

44
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,150
So this is an Akihabara date.

45
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:10,370
Go for it in Akihabara!

46
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,170
Forgive me, but in my dreams Hermes is dressed up as a maid...

47
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,060
A maid costume...

48
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,680
Welcome home, master.

49
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:39,010
No, no, she's too cute for him...

50
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,230
Should I take you to see a doctor?

51
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:47,000
Without a doubt, she'd look better in a one-piece flower-patterned dress with pigtails.

52
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,580
How's this?

53
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:00,080
I'm burning up!

54
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,680
I have to google her computer specs.

55
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:08,680
Please.

56
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,230
Sure.

57
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,910
Um...

58
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,270
Yes?

59
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,490
Want to hold hands?

60
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,570
Would you rather not?

61
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,820
With pleasure.

62
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,740
H-here you go.

63
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,700
I didn't ask you exactly what you wanted, so...

64
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,640
It may not be much help, but...

65
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,590
You've done all this for me?

66
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:33,420
This is the only thing I can do for you...

67
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,220
I'm so happy.  Thank you very much.

68
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,020
Not at all.

69
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,520
So many people here have backpacks.

70
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,740
Are they planning to stay the night somewhere?

71
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,460
No, this is a day trip for them.

72
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,430
I'm glad you found something you like.

73
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,060
Thanks to you.

74
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,060
Not at all.

75
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,360
Want to take a picture with me?

76
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,250
Over there?

77
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,110
A picture together?

78
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,390
Would you rather not?

79
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,440
No, I'd be glad to!

80
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,890
It's a little strange, but it will be a nice keepsake.

81
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,890
Thank you!

82
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,380
You're amazing!

83
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:00,930
Yamada-shi!

84
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,230
Hello.

85
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,810
Aoyama-san is here, so let's get in Shibuya-mode.

86
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:13,170
Fancy meeting you here, dude!

87
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,170
Like, totally, dude.

88
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,800
No, you don't have to do that.

89
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,130
Dude, no clue what you are saying!

90
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,570
You don't have to be in Shibuya mode anymore.

91
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,050
Huh?

92
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:30,600
So you told her you're an otaku?  That's a big step.

93
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,010
You've made some progress.

94
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,230
Here you are.

95
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:38,810
But, Aoyama-san, are you ok hanging out with our species?

96
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,230
More than just ok, this is a lot of fun.

97
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,810
What a nice person!

98
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,730
You are about 23 levels above the office ladies and high school girls...

99
00:06:44,731 --> 00:06:46,719
...who persecute us all the time.

100
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,250
That's the equivalent of about 15,000 experience points.

101
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,390
Levels?  Experience points?

102
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,690
Do you often come to Akihabara?

103
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:02,490
About 4 times a week.  We check out gal-games, figures, and show up at events...

104
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:03,710
Gal-games?

105
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,320
It's a game with beautiful girls...it's so MOE now.

106
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,790
MOE?

107
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,230
One more time, please.

108
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,390
MOE?

109
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,300
This is my secret place.

110
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,300
Really?

111
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,820
Yes.

112
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,870
You're the first person I've shown it to.

113
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:46,590
Then, from now on, this will be our secret place.

114
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,150
Sure!

115
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,330
When I come here, I can work up some courage.

116
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,300
So I only come here on special occasions.

117
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:08,490
So is it a special occasion today?

118
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,120
N-no, that's not what I meant...

119
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,710
Hey, that was your chance to tell her!

120
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:18,230
If not then, when?

121
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,450
He has to be sure that she's going to accept.

122
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,120
Umm...

123
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,120
Yes.

124
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:32,660
No...it's nothing.

125
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,720
I see.

126
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:49,070
Densha!  Are you serious about getting together with her? I can't take this anymore!

127
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,950
I thought it was a chance for me too.

128
00:08:52,090 --> 00:09:00,480
But we just made up, and if we start dating, what kind of person would I be?

129
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,390
Stop being such a wimp!

130
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:05,920
And you call yourself Japanese.  What about the Yamato-spirit?

131
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,860
Yamato-spirit doesn't mean anything these days.

132
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,580
Since they're getting along so well, I don't see the hurry.

133
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,910
Pretty soon, he won't be able to keep from telling her.

134
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,570
Let's not push him anymore.

135
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:22,760
Densha should make his own decisions instead of listening to lame guys like us.

136
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,260
Densha, you'll know the time to tell her.

137
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,630
Relax, Densha.  No matter what happens, I'm behind you.

138
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,580
Oh, yes! Oh! Oh!

139
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,320
What happened, Densha?

140
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,710
Densha's gone crazy!

141
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,760
Who got him so excited?

142
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,590
You guys were so pushy, and now he's lost it.

143
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:01,290
Come back to us, Densha!

144
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:05,260
Hermes just mailed me a picture of her in pajamas!

145
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,890
So you were all excited over her picture?

146
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:16,750
You dropped a bomb on us!  And here we are, totally defenseless...

147
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,600
Pajamas?  Is she in a neglige?

148
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,470
She's in pajamas.

149
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:23,570
And don't we look stupid for being so worried!

150
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,710
Do whatever you want, kid.

151
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,900
She's rolling around on her bed.

152
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,510
So cute...

153
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,700
Damn, I have never wanted to see her face this bad!

154
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,980
Everyone, who do you imagine she looks like?

155
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,200
I say Nakatani Miki.

156
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,250
I say Baisho Mitsuko in her prime.

157
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,860
No, no, I say Oba Kumiko.

158
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,330
Ogura Yuko a.k.a. Yuko-rin.

159
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,830
Kuninaka Ryoko!

160
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,440
You think girls that cute would hang out with Densha?

161
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,330
These dreams are the whole problem with you nerds...

162
00:10:55,330 --> 00:11:00,600
Yes, but I like her better than any girl I've ever seen on TV.

163
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,980
You Suck...

164
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:14,450
Densha, I don't know what you're thinking, but she's not your girl yet.

165
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,250
You said it!

166
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,080
So make her yours!

167
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,690
Don't forget, she owes you, not the other way around.

168
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:24,690
That's right.  Even if she wants to, she might not be able to refuse you.

169
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,690
You guys are confusing him more and more.

170
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,690
That's right.

171
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:36,960
You guys are right.  I don't know what I was thinking.  A man should know his limits.

172
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,200
I'm going to install her PC in her room.

173
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:46,400
I thought I'd finally tell her, but now I guess I won't.

174
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,840
I'm going to sleep.  Good night.

175
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,470
Just a minute!  What do you mean, her room?!

176
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,360
Why didn't you tell us something that important first?

177
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,640
You have to tell her!

178
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,770
We shouldn't have been so pushy!

179
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:02,440
We were just kidding, so tell us when you're going to see her!

180
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,490
Densha, don't you dare sleep!

181
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:07,770
Response please!  Response please!

182
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,710
The train can't run without you!

183
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,370
This way please.

184
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,480
Excuse me.

185
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,870
Mother, this is Yamada-san.

186
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,010
Welcome.

187
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:31,140
Saori, where is he?

188
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:34,610
What do you mean? This is Yamada-san.

189
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:38,380
N-n-nice to meet you.  I-I-I'm Yamada.

190
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:48,210
Saori, you've got your contacts on right?

191
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,570
Yes, I do.

192
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:52,510
Then, is this some kind of joke?

193
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,670
He looks like some kind of rodent to me.

194
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,170
Mom, you're being rude.

195
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,330
Well!

196
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,530
I got my hopes up and everything.

197
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,880
Nice meeting you.

198
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,360
Please come to my room.

199
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,470
Ok.

200
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,160
Hello, Aoyama residence.

201
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,650
Please come in.

202
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,590
Is this your room?

203
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,110
I'll bring some tea, so please make yourself comfortable.

204
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,700
Ok

205
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:56,400
Yamada seems like a nice person.  And if you squint, he doesn't look that bad.

206
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,700
Your attitude is completely different from just a minute ago.

207
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,680
Really?

208
00:13:59,681 --> 00:14:00,681
Well, how about this?

209
00:14:00,681 --> 00:14:05,700
Let's invite Yamada-san to dinner with the whole family on Sunday.

210
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,590
You're acting strange.

211
00:14:09,755 --> 00:14:11,132
It smells so good.

212
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,100
Is everything all right?

213
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:27,064
Ah... its nothing...

214
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,400
It's a nice computer.

215
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,650
Here you are.

216
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,650
Thank you.

217
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,650
Can I help with anything?

218
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:39,590
No, I'll have it running in just a minute.

219
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,890
Ok.

220
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,830
It's been hot recently.

221
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:54,440
Yes, I don't really like the summer.

222
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,520
Really?

223
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,850
I don't like it because I can't hide my body type when I wear summer clothes.

224
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:05,570
But you're slim, so I don't think there is any problem.

225
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,590
That's the problem.

226
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:08,450
Huh?

227
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:13,560
My mother and friends tell me that I'm too skinny, and have no color.

228
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,060
Oh really?

229
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,030
I suppose I'll never have a boyfriend being like this.

230
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:26,130
What?  You don't have a boyfriend?

231
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:26,880
No.

232
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,960
How about a fiance?

233
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,320
What do you mean?

234
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,260
We have confirmation!  She's available!

235
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:46,670
Free!

236
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,420
Is everything all right?

237
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,330
Yes.

238
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:58,788
But I think that no matter whether you are slim or fat, you're a wonderful person.

239
00:15:59,286 --> 00:16:01,855
Other men just don't have the sense to see it.

240
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,790
Please, don't lead me on like that.

241
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,280
Tell her.

242
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,970
Tell her.

243
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,220
TELL HER.

244
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,550
Um...

245
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,800
Please, you go first.

246
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:44,760
Actually, I was going to ask you if you'd like to eat dinner with my family on Sunday?

247
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,960
Dinner?

248
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,310
Sure.

249
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,950
Ok, I'll give you more details later.

250
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,310
Ok.

251
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,020
With her family?

252
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:09,485
What am I going to do?  Dinner with her family!

253
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:12,769
From what she says, it seems her father will not come, though.

254
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:16,130
Oh, no, why did I accept?

255
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:18,370
See, ignoring us was a mistake.

256
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,150
I guess you still have some trials before you tell her.

257
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:23,540
But with the father not being there, you only have to worry about Hermes and her mother.

258
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,560
Yes, being liked by Hermes and her mother is now your top priority mission.

259
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,030
Rich women will obviously pay attention to your appearance.

260
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,920
It's not just the rich.  My mother also doesn't like guys dressed like slobs.

261
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,310
That doesn't help us here.

262
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:36,030
But of course you should go dressed up.

263
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,800
I wonder if I can't just wear my normal dress clothes?

264
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,020
For dinner with the family, you should wear a suit.

265
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,660
If he wears a suit, everyone will pick up on his lack of fashion sense.

266
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,710
Wear a tuxedo!

267
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,820
If you have a question about suits, ask me.  I could go on for 3 hours.

268
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,240
By the way, are there other things you should be careful about at the dinner?

269
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,350
You know your table manners, right?

270
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,930
Table manners?

271
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,420
asdafawewas...

272
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,840
I guess he doesn't.

273
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,700
I'll teach you how to eat a banana like a prince...

274
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,750
It's important to have fun while you're eating.

275
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,560
Go to a seminar.

276
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,920
This is a current topic in the newspaper.

277
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,640
So you guys are talking about a new suit and table manners?

278
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,300
Looks like it's that time again!

279
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:19,300
Densha-Otoko, Revamped, Part 2!

280
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,680
2...

281
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:26,180
Excuse me, where did you buy that suit?

282
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,810
With suits, it's more important to make an impression than to be trendy.

283
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:35,760
This magazine says you should ask your coworkers who are dressed nicely.

284
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,580
Oikawa-san, where did you buy that suit?

285
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,330
Was it Paris, Milan, or New York?

286
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,110
Oh yes, this is a suit I bought in Milan.

287
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:49,850
Well, mine is not as nice as Oikawa-kun's, but this is an Italian suit...

288
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:51,850
It's not as nice as Oikawa-kun's though...

289
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,910
Talk to your boss.  They usually dress in style!

290
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,570
Really?  Wow!

291
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:04,810
Yeah, you know, I don't feel like wearing Japanese suits anymore...

292
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,513
I know what you mean.

293
00:19:06,514 --> 00:19:07,514
I see.

294
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,860
But this is written in Japanese.

295
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:15,080
Well, you see...well...huh?

296
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,910
It's important to communicate with Hermes' mother.

297
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:26,550
But being eloquent is a little beyond Densha.

298
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,910
Why don't you just compliment her?

299
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,960
Everyone likes to be complimented.

300
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,960
You'll have to bend over backwards for her.

301
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,640
What are you doing?  God, you're disgusting.

302
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,110
Oh, Jinnkama-san, no one has a sharper tongue than you.

303
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,610
Are you trying to start a fight?

304
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:51,550
No matter what happens, keep smiling.

305
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,160
Nice shot!

306
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,190
You look so young today with all that make-up on!

307
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,490
You make me sick!

308
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:01,050
Very nice! You look so attractive with that spaced-out expression on your face.

309
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,020
Nice shot!

310
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:07,790
Death.

311
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,680
I'm sure she'll smile back.

312
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,680
Oh, that felt good.

313
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,170
Last is Table Manners.

314
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:21,920
Don't hold the knife upside-down, or make sucking sounds when you have your soup.

315
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,220
Above all, you should have good manners.

316
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,280
Are you sure this is ok?

317
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,660
Yes, this is what I have to do to learn it quickly.

318
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,990
Start with the knife and fork on the outside.

319
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,520
Got it.

320
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,620
What are you guys doing?

321
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:46,400
Can you take over for me?  Just push this if he messes up.

322
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:49,650
Ok, I'll be a nice judge for him.

323
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:55,950
Use your napkin to wipe your mouth...

324
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:58,140
...before you drink.

325
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:03,000
Oh, that's too much...too much!

326
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,550
Oh, sorry.

327
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,410
Something wrong?

328
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:07,740
Your face.

329
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,820
Yamada's having dinner with you and your family?

330
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:14,260
Yes, but we haven't found a nice restaurant yet.

331
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,620
Saori, you bought a PC recently right?

332
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,620
Why don't you find one on the Net?

333
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,790
So you're surfing on the Net?

334
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,700
Hey, have you guys heard of the Aladdin Channel?

335
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,230
Aladdin Channel?

336
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:30,970
It's a board where you can get advice about anything.

337
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:39,240
Yes, but I heard that only total losers that love gossip use boards like that.

338
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:44,270
Oh, what a shame...I was going to use it to ask about men.

339
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,100
Saori, I have a friend who runs a nice restaurant.

340
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:49,120
Really?

341
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,070
Really.

342
00:22:04,414 --> 00:22:05,634
Notice of Divorce

343
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,660
Thank you for having me here today.

344
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,550
You don't need to be so nervous.

345
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,490
Can I go?

346
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:24,290
No, I need you here.

347
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:25,820
But this has nothing to do with me.

348
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,370
Thank you for coming to our restaurant today.

349
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,590
Mr. Kazuya Sakurai has made a reservation, and in fact,

350
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:36,530
in consideration of these special circumstances,

351
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:39,500
Mr. Kazuya Sakurai has reserved the entire restaurant this evening.

352
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,720
Wow, that's amazing.  The whole restaurant for us?

353
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:48,960
We are always indebted to Mr. Kazuya Sakurai.  Please, enjoy your meal.

354
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:54,880
Hey, you told them my name three times, right?

355
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:58,510
Yes, your full name.  Three times.

356
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:04,200
Ok, everyone listen up.  This restaurant is mine tonight.

357
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:07,030
You will follow all my orders.  Got it?

358
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:08,310
Yes, sir!

359
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:13,200
Densha, this is the end for you.

360
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:25,600
It's spicy.

361
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,180
Mm, this is good.

362
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,100
It's refreshing.

363
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,480
It's good, isn't it?

364
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,120
Yes, it is.

365
00:23:36,254 --> 00:23:37,924
"For Yamada"

366
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,190
Thank you.

367
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:59,240
Drink!  Drink!  Drink!

368
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:04,430
It's hot!

369
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:06,430
Drink!  Drink!

370
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:16,640
That's right!  Drink up so we can bring out the main dish!

371
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,670
I can't hold it.

372
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,440
Please excuse me.

373
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,380
All right!

374
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:40,710
Come on out!

375
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,150
Fake Tsuyoshi.

376
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:51,030
We're counting on you.

377
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,920
Are you sure you want to use me?

378
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:58,970
Huh?  No problem, you look just like him. Don't worry.  Ok, let's do it.

379
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:00,190
Ok.

380
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,430
Dad?

381
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,540
Did he say "dad"?

382
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:24,000
Hold on!  Not now!

383
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,030
What's the meaning of this?

384
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,800
Mom, tell us what's going on.

385
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,050
Mom?

386
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:39,395
I have nothing to talk about with just the two of us here.

387
00:25:40,751 --> 00:25:41,751
That's why I asked you to come.

388
00:25:42,821 --> 00:25:43,821
Unbelievable.

389
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:45,994
Why didn't you tell us?

390
00:25:45,995 --> 00:25:47,525
Because if I had, you wouldn't have come!

391
00:25:47,526 --> 00:25:48,600
Of course we wouldn't have.

392
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:49,980
Yuki.

393
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,010
Did you bring it?

394
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,890
Let's not talk about it here.

395
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:03,500
So that's your plan.  Running away again.  Just sign it here.

396
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,690
Dad, not here.

397
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,130
Excuse me.

398
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:17,570
Who are you?

399
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:22,260
I-I-I'm...

400
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,180
Yamada Tsuyoshi-san.  My friend.

401
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,650
I see...

402
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:29,150
I'm Saori's father.

403
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:30,150
What?

404
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:36,480
I'm sorry, but I have a important matter to discuss with my family.

405
00:26:36,481 --> 00:26:37,481
Would you excuse us?

406
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,960
Ok, I'll go now.

407
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,050
I'm sorry.

408
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:55,070
Thank you all.

409
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:16,750
I need to get going too.  Good night.

410
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:44,398
It's been 8 years.

411
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:48,000
You said you didn't want a divorce till Keisuke graduated from college.

412
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,410
So I waited.  This has gone on long enough.

413
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:01,020
I have plans tonight.  Let's get this over with.

414
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,630
She's waiting for you?

415
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:04,070
That's of no concern to you.

416
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,430
Mom, it's over.

417
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,460
Keisuke, you be quiet.

418
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:10,244
This is a problem for all of us.

419
00:28:10,245 --> 00:28:13,949
Thanks to the two of you, Saori has lost trust in men.

420
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,230
Keisuke...

421
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,780
Don't involve us in this.

422
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:19,830
Is that right, Saori?

423
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,690
Like you care!

424
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:22,970
You keep quiet.

425
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,270
Keisuke, stop!

426
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,860
E-excuse me.

427
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,290
I forgot something.

428
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,460
I'm leaving.

429
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:41,200
Hurry up and get it.

430
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,560
Excuse me.

431
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,080
You're still here?

432
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,440
No.

433
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:37,630
I think marriage is an amazing thing.

434
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,900
Just dating someone is such a difficult thing,

435
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:55,510
Proposing to someone, meeting their parents, buying a ring,

436
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:05,050
having a wedding, it must take an unimaginable

437
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,520
amount of courage.

438
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,880
What are you trying to say?

439
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,830
Be quiet.

440
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:18,010
Actually, I don't know what I am really trying to say...

441
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:28,730
but I don't want to see Aoyama-san sad...

442
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:36,330
I have a father and mother too.

443
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:44,080
Unlike your family, my father is completely undependable,

444
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:48,800
and my mother is almost never home...

445
00:30:51,380 --> 00:31:00,840
but they always laugh...at stupid things.

446
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:10,060
So I laugh along with them.

447
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:28,930
Children want their parents to be happy...more than anyone else.

448
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:40,230
They want their parents to laugh.

449
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:51,380
I'm sorry.

450
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:07,760
Here you go.  The notice of divorce.  I signed it and everything.

451
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:09,760
Yuki...

452
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:13,750
See you later.

453
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,460
Mom.

454
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:48,560
Saori, I think I know why you picked him now.

455
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,000
Go ahead.

456
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,410
Saori.

457
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,270
I'm sorry.

458
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,430
Dad!

459
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,610
See you later.

460
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:50,810
I can't believe it...Densha Otoko.

461
00:33:57,124 --> 00:33:58,124
Um...

462
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,470
Would you like to hold hands?

463
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:07,740
Yes.

464
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:28,310
That's it...

465
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,950
Wow!  I could cry, Densha!

466
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:32,610
Someone must have cast a spell on that suit.

467
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,670
No, he didn't need the suit after all.

468
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,110
The only thing matters is that everything went ok.

469
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,160
And it looks like Hermes' mother approves of you.

470
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,470
Mission cleared!

471
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:40,940
That takes care of your blind spot.

472
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,850
Now it's time to tell her!

473
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,240
It's getting exciting!

474
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,320
Speaking of excitement, this board's been getting pretty famous.

475
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,130
Lots of people are getting interested.

476
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:50,600
Finding out about interesting places is a common habit of people.

477
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,460
That's right, I heard some high school girls talking about this thread.

478
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,340
My friend knew about it too.  I was surprised.

479
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,650
We've gotten famous.

480
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:03,500
But, if it's gotten this big, someday Hermes will learn about this board.

481
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:16,330
It's possible her friends will find out about it too.

482
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:18,350
Oh no!  Oh no!

483
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,930
What do you think, Densha?

484
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,400
I don't think it's such a big deal.

485
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,570
How can you say that?

486
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:27,480
How can you take it so lightly?

487
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,260
All your inner thoughts are written here.

488
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:33,060
"Oh, oh, this is looking good."   "I have no experience with women."

489
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,450
Everything you've written is there for her to check.

490
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:40,060
"Find a restaurant for me, guys."  She's going to find out about that too.

491
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,170
She's going to find out about me too!

492
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:44,160
We're all anonymous, so what does it matter?

493
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:47,660
Densha, she's going to find out about you getting excited over her picture.

494
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,940
Don't scare me like that.

495
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:52,910
Densha, this is a HUGE problem!

496
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:55,290
If she finds out, there's no doubt Hermes is going to hate you.

497
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:57,740
No matter how nice she is, Hermes is not going to forgive you for exposing her like this.

498
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:02,710
As a woman, I don't think I would like being talked about like this.

499
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,710
That's a sincere opinion.

500
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,370
Talking about your first date, and holding hands...

501
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:11,170
From a woman's perspective, that's something that should be kept between the two of you.

502
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:14,200
Having all your casual comments written down...

503
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,330
...would ruin everything.

504
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:18,830
The stalker was something she only talked to you about.

505
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:22,490
If she sees that on the Net, she'll probably cry.

506
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:25,850
Putting her misunderstanding about your surfing on display would be tough on her too.

507
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:30,540
She could see this as you disclosing all the details of her private life.

508
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:36,340
After reading all your messages, I think Hermes could see this as a betrayal of trust!

509
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,340
BETRAYAL

510
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,590
betrayal?

511
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,730
I never even considered that.

512
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:48,140
Was I betraying her trust in me?

513
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:13,810
Well, anyway, this is a "what-if" situation, don't worry about it.

514
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:16,920
So you're saying just drop it like this?  That's not going to work.

515
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,310
I think you should tell her before she finds out on her own.

516
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:22,280
Densha, if you feel guilty, then tell her.

517
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,220
But if you tell her, she's going to hate you!

518
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:31,240
There's not even a 1 percent chance she's going to find out.

519
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,800
It's not a betrayal if she doesn't find out.

520
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,990
I think if you tell her, she'll understand.

521
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:38,070
No, way, you guys will be finished.

522
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:40,630
She's going to die from shock when she sees it.

523
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:46,370
If she finds out, you have no chance to go to the World Cup.  Benoist!

524
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:47,650
Respond, soldier!

525
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:49,370
Densha, talk to us!

526
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:51,950
Are you listening?

527
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:19,450
I've tried everything, but I can't make it back to that world.

528
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,530
Farewell, Densha!

529
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,140
Ow! Ow! Ow!

530
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:37,000
Wait a minute!  Could this little piece be the problem?

531
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:46,880
Alright.  Wait for me, Densha!  Ok, where does this go?

532
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:54,430
Hey, what are you doing?

533
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,430
Is this...?

534
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:56,620
No, it's not.

535
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,780
What does this mean?

536
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,120
I have no idea what you mean.

537
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,200
Why are they talking about my sister?

538
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,920
Did you write about her?

539
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,720
No way!

540
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:09,410
Then it must be him.  Yamada.

541
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,330
So you got together with me to spy on my sister?

542
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:15,990
No way!

543
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:19,850
I've been such a fool.

544
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,320
Hey, wait!

545
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:46,270
It's not like we're trying to scare you, Densha.

546
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:49,210
It's just that if she finds out, she's going to explode.

547
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:51,820
We're telling you this because we're thinking of you.

548
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:54,100
We don't want to see you hurt.

549
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,600
But if you tell her, she'll go crazy for sure!

550
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,010
Are you willing to throw away all you've worked for?

551
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:08,000
I wonder if this means we're always going to be single.

552
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:11,280
But no matter what, we want this to work out.

553
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,300
We're thinking about you when we say this.  Don't tell her!

554
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,760
I think that whether you betrayed her or not is all in the way you look at it.

555
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:39,836
But I'd like you give us an answer based on what this board means to you.

556
00:41:16,179 --> 00:41:19,527
I was happy to read your messages.

557
00:41:21,843 --> 00:41:24,067
Thank you all for your concern.

558
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:33,050
But I can't let things go on like this.

559
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:48,260
I've told you guys everything about the two of us.

560
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:56,670
She might see that as a terrible thing.

561
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,225
But without you guys,...

562
00:42:04,226 --> 00:42:11,329
...there is no way we would have gotten together.

563
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,332
If I hadn't written you guys about us,...

564
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:20,912
...I never would have had any self-esteem.

565
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:31,550
And I never would have met friends as great as you.

566
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:41,440
I made it this far because you guys were right with me.

567
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:50,070
I'm proud of this board.

568
00:42:55,260 --> 00:43:01,950
So I'm going to go and tell her about it.

569
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:10,240
I'm going to tell her about all of you, my dear friends.

570
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,260
I want her to understand.

571
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:31,420
There are feelings I can't express in words.

572
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,500
I'm sorry guys.

573
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,360
And, thank you.

574
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:58,480
What happened?  You look angry.

575
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:00,950
You've been played by that guy Yamada.

576
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:05,700
That bastard's been writing about you on the Net.

577
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:12,140
He wrote about the day you met him, and your trauma.

578
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:14,830
He's been laughing at you, telling everyone.

579
00:44:25,093 --> 00:44:26,093
It can't be.

580
00:44:29,688 --> 00:44:31,298
Oh, no.

581
00:44:32,007 --> 00:44:34,167
"Oh, yes!  Oh!  Oh!"

582
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,650
What a bastard.

583
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,450
"...stalker..."     "...surfing..."

584
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,230
He totally stabbed you in the back.
