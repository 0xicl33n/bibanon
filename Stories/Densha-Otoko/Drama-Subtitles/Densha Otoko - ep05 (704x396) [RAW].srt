[Good luck at work, and work hard]

2
00:00:02,613 --> 00:00:05,084
Working hard.

3
00:00:06,645 --> 00:00:07,950
Yamada!

4
00:00:08,707 --> 00:00:09,946
Huh?

5
00:00:13,449 --> 00:00:15,170
Did you learn to surf in time?

6
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:16,363
No,

7
00:00:16,363 --> 00:00:18,941
but when I apologised, she forgave me.

8
00:00:18,941 --> 00:00:20,975
I knew it.

9
00:00:20,975 --> 00:00:22,602
Ah, wai- give it back.

10
00:00:22,602 --> 00:00:23,894
This girl,

11
00:00:23,894 --> 00:00:26,202
she doesn't know does she?

12
00:00:26,202 --> 00:00:28,148
What?

13
00:00:30,611 --> 00:00:32,746
That...

14
00:00:32,746 --> 00:00:36,716
you're an otaku.

15
00:00:36,716 --> 00:00:37,781
Otaku

16
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:41,699
I wonder what she'd do if she found out.

17
00:00:41,699 --> 00:00:46,250
If it was me, I'd probably never see you again.

18
00:00:47,675 --> 00:00:51,533
Work hard, and good luck at work.

19
00:00:51,568 --> 00:00:53,428
Otaku idiot.

20
00:01:09,213 --> 00:01:10,202
What is it?

21
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:12,167
Nothing.

22
00:01:23,337 --> 00:01:25,414
I'm sorry for the trouble.

23
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,877
I didn't think Yuki would drink so much.

24
00:01:28,877 --> 00:01:31,223
It was only class reunion afterall.

25
00:01:31,223 --> 00:01:32,809
Did something happen to her recently?

26
00:01:32,809 --> 00:01:34,477
Why do you ask?

27
00:01:35,082 --> 00:01:39,250
Something to do with her Father maybe..

28
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,770
How can you say that?

29
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,138
Doesn't it matter how I feel?

30
00:01:43,138 --> 00:01:44,681
Leave me alone already.

31
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:48,474
Did she say anything?

32
00:01:48,474 --> 00:01:49,938
No no.

33
00:01:49,938 --> 00:01:52,204
It's probably just my imagination.

34
00:01:52,683 --> 00:01:54,550
Don't worry about it.

35
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:08,820
Thank you very much.

When's someday?

56
00:03:35,557 --> 00:03:37,525
I don't even get asked to matching parties anymore.

57
00:03:37,525 --> 00:03:41,022
I have to look for places to meet guys using a magnifying glass.

58
00:03:41,022 --> 00:03:42,045
Think about it,

59
00:03:42,045 --> 00:03:45,092
the chance of meeting a hot guy out on the street like this...

60
00:03:45,197 --> 00:03:46,400
could be pretty good.

61
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,541
What?

62
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:49,695
Hey, it's Yamada Tsuyoshi.

63
00:03:49,695 --> 00:03:50,991
Yamada?

64
00:03:50,991 --> 00:03:52,223
What, that Yamada?

65
00:03:52,223 --> 00:03:53,935
Yeah, THE Yamada.

66
00:03:53,935 --> 00:03:57,528
He's great, it's destiny, how dramatic.

67
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:59,816
You should haved figured it out from our conversations.

68
00:03:59,816 --> 00:04:01,109
It's the puny one.

69
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:02,548
Oh.

70
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,595
The friend is seriously good looking.

71
00:04:04,595 --> 00:04:07,583
Huh? A matching party?

72
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:10,495
Um.. If you don't want to, you don't have to.

73
00:04:10,844 --> 00:04:12,052
Yamada,

74
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:13,876
take this with you when you go.

75
00:04:13,876 --> 00:04:15,479
Ok, I got it.

76
00:04:16,325 --> 00:04:18,148
Really? It's ok.

77
00:04:18,148 --> 00:04:20,620
Uh..That.. That.. was..

78
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,173
There will be 3 of us then.

79
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:26,783
Yes, see you there.

80
00:04:39,806 --> 00:04:42,237
I got asked to a matching party by Hermes-san.

81
00:04:42,237 --> 00:04:46,268
I said ok in the spur of the moment, but this is a problem right?

82
00:04:49,486 --> 00:04:51,319
Of course it's a big problem.

83
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:52,339
I can't help you there though,

84
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:54,167
that's unknown territory.

85
00:04:54,167 --> 00:04:56,901
I can't think of Hemes going to a matching party.

86
00:04:56,901 --> 00:04:58,733
Then let it to me!

87
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:01,855
Her friends might have asked her to arrange it.

88
00:05:04,183 --> 00:05:06,454
You're new.

89
00:05:06,454 --> 00:05:07,895
I've been assigned here now.

90
00:05:07,895 --> 00:05:08,830
I hope we can get along.

91
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,342
My name is-

92
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,358
It's ok.

93
00:05:10,358 --> 00:05:13,086
No one else but you comes here anyway.

94
00:05:16,741 --> 00:05:19,414
You're only going to make a fool out of yourself.  Decline.

95
00:05:19,414 --> 00:05:20,793
1st look good, 2 go with the flow

96
00:05:20,793 --> 00:05:22,304
3 make it happen.

97
00:05:22,304 --> 00:05:24,385
They say your friends say a lot about who you are.

98
00:05:24,385 --> 00:05:27,585
Just find some friends who you can show Hermes.

99
00:05:27,585 --> 00:05:31,673
Just don't call any Otaku friends, it's going to hurt otherwise.

100
00:05:31,673 --> 00:05:33,143
Otaku

101
00:05:34,073 --> 00:05:37,426
This is all getting out of hand.

102
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,431
What should I do?

103
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:43,346
Hey, hey!

104
00:05:43,346 --> 00:05:44,858
Don't close it, touch it, or look at it.

105
00:05:44,858 --> 00:05:45,817
Got it?

106
00:05:45,817 --> 00:05:47,504
Yes.

107
00:05:50,223 --> 00:05:52,392
A matching party?

108
00:05:52,392 --> 00:05:55,192
That's going to be a problem.

109
00:05:55,192 --> 00:05:57,207
It's been a while,

110
00:05:57,242 --> 00:05:59,345
how's work been since then?

111
00:06:00,808 --> 00:06:02,272
Oikawa-san,

112
00:06:02,272 --> 00:06:05,330
I can take you to a matching party if you want.

113
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,024
No, thats' too arrogant.

114
00:06:08,024 --> 00:06:08,920
Oikawa-sama,

115
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,169
could you possibly accompany me to matching party?

116
00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:14,308
and that's too formal.

117
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:16,386
A matching party?  Sure.

118
00:06:16,386 --> 00:06:17,822
When is it?

119
00:06:17,822 --> 00:06:18,860
It's tonight.

120
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,838
Tonight?

121
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,436
OK I'll leave my schedule open.

122
00:06:21,436 --> 00:06:22,894
Really?

123
00:06:23,472 --> 00:06:25,359
Thank you so much!

124
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:27,435
Don't cry.

125
00:06:27,435 --> 00:06:29,108
A matching party?

126
00:06:29,441 --> 00:06:30,849
Why?

127
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,280
I don't know.

128
00:06:38,376 --> 00:06:40,361
Good evening ladies.

129
00:06:40,931 --> 00:06:42,924
Good evening.

130
00:06:43,407 --> 00:06:44,516
Why?

131
00:06:44,516 --> 00:06:45,822
Why does this kind of thing happen?

132
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,881
Ow, ow, you're strangling me.

133
00:06:47,881 --> 00:06:49,761
I've gone to the beauty salon for this,

134
00:06:49,761 --> 00:06:51,003
and went to a spa,

135
00:06:51,003 --> 00:06:53,771
and got my nails done at a store that movie stars go to.

136
00:06:53,771 --> 00:06:54,650
For the first time in a year,

137
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:58,139
no, in 3 years, I bought underwear that's not beige.

138
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:00,035
Yuka, you're going to kill me!

139
00:07:00,035 --> 00:07:02,314
Why were we drafted for this mission?

140
00:07:02,314 --> 00:07:04,570
The other guys cancelled at the last minute.

141
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,119
But to ask us to hide our Otaku.

142
00:07:07,154 --> 00:07:08,715
Is really pushing the limits of credibility.

143
00:07:08,715 --> 00:07:11,378
And that's what I'm begging you to try.

144
00:07:11,378 --> 00:07:13,219
Is there something the matter?

145
00:07:17,844 --> 00:07:19,425
Gyha!  It went well!

146
00:07:19,425 --> 00:07:21,250
The women seemed to be happy.

147
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,991
I guess you should give anything a chance.

148
00:07:22,991 --> 00:07:25,702
Kawamoto-shi, your jive was magnificent.

149
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:28,025
Oh, dude.  I'm so in trouble.

150
00:07:28,025 --> 00:07:29,890
Even deader than the MK5!

151
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:31,233
Stop it, stop it,

152
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:33,010
Matsunaga-shi, you were great too.

153
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,360
Your sea turtle gag had them rolling in their seats.

154
00:07:36,737 --> 00:07:39,122
I hate to say it myself, but-

155
00:07:39,122 --> 00:07:40,401
that was the worst dirty joke ever!

156
00:07:40,401 --> 00:07:42,313
How do they come up with something so lame?

157
00:07:42,313 --> 00:07:43,480
We're talking about sea turtles laying eggs.

158
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,584
It was so realistic it was gross.

159
00:07:45,584 --> 00:07:49,329
The act with the glasses was so pathetic he had me shivering.

160
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:52,145
I'll tear them apart with my bare hands!!

161
00:07:52,145 --> 00:07:53,516
Wait, senpai!

162
00:07:54,929 --> 00:07:57,810
I wonder if everything went ok.

163
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,314
Hm?

164
00:07:59,314 --> 00:08:00,881
Uh.. well...

165
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:05,929
It's just that it seemed your friends
looked angry when we left the store.

166
00:08:06,814 --> 00:08:10,376
I think they had a good time.

167
00:08:10,376 --> 00:08:13,551
I had a good time too.

168
00:08:13,551 --> 00:08:17,600
I'm glad you said that.

169
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,975
Did you hear about the stalker?

170

00:19:06,101 --> 00:19:10,240
Mother?  You don't want Keisuke to come back home?

337
00:19:15,637 --> 00:19:17,105
Not a bit.

338
00:19:20,053 --> 00:19:23,022
Keisuke always sides with his Father.

339
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:36,724
Densha, aren't you forgetting something?

340
00:19:36,724 --> 00:19:38,954
It's good that you're enjoying your peaceful time together,

341
00:19:38,954 --> 00:19:41,058
but that's not solving any of her problems.

342
00:19:41,058 --> 00:19:42,251
Forward, Melos.

343
00:19:42,251 --> 00:19:43,866
That's true.

344
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:46,219
I really do want to do something.

345
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:49,306
Without knowing the identity of the stalker
there isn't much we can do.

346
00:19:49,306 --> 00:19:51,627
It's not a job for amateurs like us.

347
00:19:51,627 --> 00:19:53,058
It would he good to have some hints.

348
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:55,210
How about those photos that were sent to Hermes-san?

349
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:58,564
Depending on the angle of the shot,
you can figure out where it was taken.

350
00:19:58,564 --> 00:19:59,395
Good point.

351
00:19:59,395 --> 00:20:01,644
That's definitely worth following up on.

352
00:20:01,644 --> 00:20:03,651
What are you planning on doing once you find the stalker?

353
00:20:03,651 --> 00:20:04,851
There's no way you'll find him.

354
00:20:04,851 --> 00:20:06,250
It it was me, I'd start by hitting him.

355
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,300
Will Densha have the muscles to fight the stalker?
I'm worried.

356
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,331
He might have a knife.

357
00:20:10,331 --> 00:20:11,648
Knife

358
00:20:14,787 --> 00:20:17,356
Don't spook me out like that.

359
00:20:17,356 --> 00:20:19,019
But if I do find him-

360
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:20,516
Sic the police on him.

361
00:20:20,516 --> 00:20:22,700
I'd lecture him for 5 hours.

362
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,339
Find him first, then think about it.

363
00:20:24,339 --> 00:20:27,084
You'll deal with it in your way.

364
00:20:37,517 --> 00:20:39,781
The photos are in here.

365
00:20:40,292 --> 00:20:41,836
Thank you.

366
00:20:42,477 --> 00:20:43,989
Let's go.

367
00:20:47,548 --> 00:20:49,838
But what are you planning to do?

368
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:52,384
Don't worry about anything.

369
00:20:52,403 --> 00:20:56,076
I'll protect you no matter what.

370
00:21:04,593 --> 00:21:05,937

I'm sorry.

379
00:21:27,201 --> 00:21:29,586
I have things I have to do.

380
00:21:29,586 --> 00:21:31,818
Bah~  Hey, phone.

381
00:21:31,818 --> 00:21:33,386
I'm Yamada's supervisor.

382
00:21:33,386 --> 00:21:35,314
Yamada's currently busy, and cannot come to the phone.

383
00:21:35,314 --> 00:21:37,554
I'll take your message for him.

384
00:21:37,554 --> 00:21:40,715
Ok, all right.  Uh huh.

385
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:42,770
Here, have it back.

386
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,203
It's from some girl called Aoyama.

387
00:21:44,203 --> 00:21:45,658
She'll be meeting a friend today,

388
00:21:45,658 --> 00:21:48,355
so she doesn't need you to pick her up.

389
00:21:48,355 --> 00:21:49,516
A f, f, friend?

390
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:52,487
Her f, f, friend, is probably a guy.

391
00:22:05,664 --> 00:22:07,287
So what's Mom learning today?

00:22:07,287 --> 00:22:08,208
Otoko (1st 2 syllables reversed)

393
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,391

397
00:22:15,136 --> 00:22:17,800
I got a call from Hermes-san saying she'll be meeting a friend,

398
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,821
and so she wouldn't need me to walk her back.

399
00:22:20,821 --> 00:22:22,925
I think I messed up.

400
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,554
A friend...could be a significant other.

401
00:22:24,554 --> 00:22:26,385
That's her boyfriend for sure.

402
00:22:26,385 --> 00:22:29,010
Did you ask her if she was seeing anyone?

403
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,033
Not yet.

404
00:22:30,033 --> 00:22:32,714
It doesn't sound like it from what you've told us so far.

405
00:22:32,714 --> 00:22:35,579
It might have all been for nothing.

406
00:22:35,579 --> 00:22:38,208
She has her own life too.

407
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,354
That's true.

408
00:22:40,354 --> 00:22:41,922
From her POV,

409
00:22:41,922 --> 00:22:44,418
it might have all been a bother.

410
00:22:44,418 --> 00:22:45,715
Maybe,

411
00:22:45,715 --> 00:22:48,111
I'm just a stalker too.

412
00:22:48,111 --> 00:22:51,832
Don't worry about it.  Just think about protecting her.

413
00:22:52,155 --> 00:22:54,445
Quit thinking negatively.

414
00:22:55,155 --> 00:22:56,292
It doesn't matter if she has a boyfriend,

415
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:58,834
or if she thinks you're a bother.

416
00:22:58,834 --> 00:23:04,120
You're working hard to make sure she stays safe, right?

417
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,251
You're right.

418
00:23:12,251 --> 00:23:14,601
I lost sight of what I was doing.

419
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:17,228
I'll go and find her stalker now.

420
00:23:31,469 --> 00:23:35,108
I'll protect you!

421
00:23:40,365 --> 00:23:44,444
He seemed pretty enthusiastic, but is it going to go that easily?

422
00:23:44,444 --> 00:23:48,229
His movements will be between her station and her house.

423
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:52,518
It's here.

424

Next!

425
00:24:03,085 --> 00:24:05,543
This looks like it.

426
00:24:05,543 --> 00:24:08,012
Maybe he'll be mistaken as a stalker himself.

427
00:24:08,012 --> 00:24:12,025
I can imagine him being questioned right now.

428
00:24:14,351 --> 00:24:18,048
It's going to take a while investigating each picture one by one.

I know what you're trying to say.

But Mother-

433
00:24:35,565 --> 00:24:39,094
Then why hasn't she called me once?

434
00:24:39,094 --> 00:24:42,464
I was just telling her to divorce and try to start moving ahead.

435
00:24:43,138 --> 00:24:43,675
She just-

436
00:24:43,872 --> 00:24:48,266
That's why she can't apologize.
She hasn't been able to  move forward.

437
00:24:48,266 --> 00:24:52,373
Mother's not that strong.

I don't know what they're thinking.

504
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:21,575
I try to act differently so she'll like me,

505
00:33:22,163 --> 00:33:24,572
but it doesn't work.

506
00:33:25,794 --> 00:33:28,542
When I'm with Aoyama-san,

507
00:33:28,542 --> 00:33:31,917
I'm just as scared as I am happy.

508
00:33:32,664 --> 00:33:37,959
Never knowing when this happiness is going to disappear.

509
00:33:40,709 --> 00:33:46,535
I'm really a pathetic guy.

510
00:33:47,448 --> 00:33:50,674
It work I'm always scolded.

511
00:33:50,921 --> 00:33:53,785
I'm made fun of by my family.

512
00:33:54,605 --> 00:33:56,628
Anything I try,

513
00:33:56,663 --> 00:33:58,946
I can't do right.

514
00:34:04,428 --> 00:34:07,975
It's the same when I'm with Aoyama-san.

515
00:34:10,028 --> 00:34:12,024
When I call her,

516
00:34:12,024 --> 00:34:14,022
my hands are always shaking.

517
00:34:14,022 --> 00:34:16,239
And my voice gets all squeaky.

518
00:34:18,683 --> 00:34:22,196
Because I don't want to be seen wearing the same clothes,

519
00:34:22,196 --> 00:34:24,964
I buy a new set every time.

520
00:34:27,582 --> 00:34:30,364
I can hardly drink,

521
00:34:30,364 --> 00:34:33,646
but I pass it off like I hardly feel it.

522
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:42,916
I really want to know if she has a boyfriend,

523
00:34:44,822 --> 00:34:47,388
but I'm so afraid of the answer

524
00:34:47,388 --> 00:34:49,617
I can't ask her.

525
00:34:56,821 --> 00:34:59,806
And that's why

526
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,601
I can empathize.

527
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:05,565
I've felt everything you've felt.

528
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:15,263
I'm like a stalker too.

529
00:35:22,964 --> 00:35:27,521
That's not so.

530
00:35:31,944 --> 00:35:37,245
All I ever did was hurt her.

531
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:42,865
But you...

532
00:35:59,216 --> 00:36:03,990
This is my best picture of her.

533
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:30,671
I also wanted to become like you.

534
00:36:38,076 --> 00:36:41,033
I didn't get here on my own.

535
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:46,981
There's people out there,

536
00:36:47,884 --> 00:36:49,886
who cheer me on,

537
00:36:50,388 --> 00:36:51,913
and scold me,

538
00:36:53,604 --> 00:36:55,146
and encourage me.

539
00:36:57,068 --> 00:37:01,197
I have all these people,

540
00:37:01,197 --> 00:37:03,900
who watch over me.

541
00:37:05,583 --> 00:37:06,654
Try again tomorrow.

542
00:37:06,654 --> 00:37:09,749
It's the first time I've ever really cheered someone on.

543
00:37:09,749 --> 00:37:11,136
Please,

544
00:37:11,136 --> 00:37:13,432
let everything go well.

545
00:37:13,822 --> 00:37:15,391
Densha, you're our hope.

546
00:37:15,391 --> 00:37:17,648
Take it easy for today.

547
00:37:17,648 --> 00:37:18,605
B.

548
00:37:18,605 --> 00:37:19,436
Densha

549
00:37:19,436 --> 00:37:20,487
Densha

550
00:37:20,487 --> 00:37:23,113
You can do it, Densha Otoko.

551
00:37:40,362 --> 00:37:42,478
Ok, I'm ready.

552
00:37:44,635 --> 00:37:49,699
You can take me in now, I'll go wherever you tell me.

553
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:53,509
Then,

554
00:37:54,804 --> 00:37:57,882
let's go see Aoyama-san.

555
00:37:59,892 --> 00:38:05,180
And apologize to her.

556
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:16,646
I'll go with you.

557
00:38:43,682 --> 00:38:45,669
[That's true.]
[Still, he taking forever.]
[Maybe the tables got turned.  Is he ok?]

558
00:38:45,669 --> 00:38:47,138
Densha's talking forever.

559
00:38:47,138 --> 00:38:49,063
Maybe he's been pummeled already.

560
00:38:49,063 --> 00:38:51,747
Carried into a hospital in an ambulance.

561
00:38:51,747 --> 00:38:55,258
Even without Densha here, there's an awful lot of us here.

562
00:38:55,258 --> 00:38:58,690
We're a strange group aren't we?

563
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:01,050
Bound by solidarity?

564
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:03,034
Friendship! Comrades! Unity!

565
00:39:03,034 --> 00:39:05,043
Sounds like something out of a teenage comic.

566
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:09,219
I thought we all hated the idea of banding together.

567
00:39:09,219 --> 00:39:10,823
It's the opposite.

568
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:14,811
I think that's what we're all hoping for.

569
00:39:23,605 --> 00:39:27,042
I just like being here.

570
00:39:35,645 --> 00:39:39,422
It's getting mushy in here. You guy are laying it on a little thick.

571
00:39:48,806 --> 00:39:52,043
Densha, when are getting back?

572
00:40:02,447 --> 00:40:04,325
[Express]
[Densha Otoko]

573
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:14,418
[We're all with you!]

574
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,384
Kaoru-chan,

575
00:40:22,384 --> 00:40:24,988
It's getting late; you should sleep.

576
00:40:26,655 --> 00:40:28,345
Good night.

577
00:40:31,041 --> 00:40:32,958
Good night.

578
00:40:41,569 --> 00:40:43,543
This is the second time.

579
00:40:45,121 --> 00:40:48,042
That I've been saved by you.

580
00:40:48,491 --> 00:40:49,086
No, no.

581
00:40:49,479 --> 00:40:54,632
It seems like I'm always causing a commotion.

582
00:40:57,729 --> 00:41:01,849
He was saying he'd go back to the country side.

583
00:41:01,849 --> 00:41:03,314
Really?

584
00:41:19,806 --> 00:41:21,139
Um.

585
00:41:21,484 --> 00:41:22,530
Yes?

586
00:41:26,989 --> 00:41:30,363
When I called your cell phone earlier,

587
00:41:31,677 --> 00:41:34,827
a, a , a man answered.

588
00:41:34,862 --> 00:41:35,981
Hm?

589
00:41:38,172 --> 00:41:39,974
My cell..

590
00:41:46,381 --> 00:41:48,538
It must be at Keisuke's

591
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,897
Keisuke?

592
00:41:52,636 --> 00:41:54,877
He's my little brother.

593
00:41:58,901 --> 00:42:00,874
Your brother.

594
00:42:07,565 --> 00:42:09,340
It's late, who is it?

595
00:42:17,861 --> 00:42:19,354
What happened?

596
00:42:20,573 --> 00:42:23,830
Here, Saori forgot this.

597
00:42:25,949 --> 00:42:28,226
You came here just for that?

598
00:42:40,174 --> 00:42:42,801
Man, I'm hungry.

599
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:47,583
All we have's beer.

600
00:42:59,537 --> 00:43:00,831
I'm back.

601
00:43:05,384 --> 00:43:07,728
Thank you for today.

602
00:43:07,728 --> 00:43:08,905
No,

603
00:43:08,905 --> 00:43:12,609
Thank you.

604
00:43:12,609 --> 00:43:14,278
I'll mail you again.

605
00:43:15,018 --> 00:43:16,408
Ok.

606
00:43:16,785 --> 00:43:18,089
Good night.

607
00:43:18,089 --> 00:43:19,514
Good night.

608
00:44:03,208 --> 00:44:06,245
Could I walk you home?

609
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:14,558
Yes.

610
00:44:20,985 --> 00:44:22,109
Densha,

611
00:44:22,146 --> 00:44:25,537
If you're not back yet, could it mean...?

612
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:28,510
Did he finally tell her!

613
00:46:07,124 --> 00:46:13,129
We'll be giving out a 100 CDs containing the ending theme
for this drama as performed by Sambo Master.
