What?!

00:00:18,014 --> 00:00:21,018
Akiba? You mean the fortress of Otakus,'Akihabara'?

All right. I will tell you what happened

00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,943
Um... Do you remember the promise?

17

How are you... going to use the computer?

33
00:01:25,733 --> 00:01:28,336
Just to access the Internet... and write mails

34
00:01:28,336 --> 00:01:30,779
Then... it must be easy to use

35

38

149
00:07:55,678 --> 00:07:58,071
I get courage

150
00:07:58,071 --> 00:07:59,079
So

151
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:03,983
I only come here on special occasions

152
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:08,837

Densha, you sure you want to go out with Hermes-san!?

165
00:08:47,874 --> 00:08:49,527
You are not even qualified to be a human-!!

166
00:08:49,527 --> 00:08:52,283
I did think it was a chance...

167
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:54,924
But, it hasn't been long since we got back...

168
00:08:54,924 --> 00:08:56,422
And I thought

169
00:08:56,422 --> 00:09:00,373
"If I do get to go out with her, what kind of person am I?" So...

170
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,276
Don't be weak!

171
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:03,890
And you say you are a Japanese!

172

00:09:05,686 --> 00:09:08,801
Well, Yamato spirit has nothing to do with this... Or so I thought

174
00:09:08,801 --> 00:09:10,338
If you are sincerely seeing her and the atmosphere is warm

175
00:09:10,338 --> 00:09:12,575
Then I don't think you need to hurry and tell her

176
00:09:12,575 --> 00:09:15,699
Your urge to confess will be uncontrollable until you actually do it

177
00:09:15,699 --> 00:09:17,374
Let's not push him anymore

178
00:09:17,374 --> 00:09:20,020
For now, rather than bunch of singles telling him what to do

179
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,779
Densha's own choice is more valid

180
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:24,967
Densha, tell her when you think the time is right

181
00:09:37,752 --> 00:09:39,861
Relax

182
00:09:39,861 --> 00:09:43,831
Whatever happens, I will be with you to the end

183
00:09:43,831 --> 00:09:48,175
Haa Haa Haa Haaaa~

184
00:09:48,175 --> 00:09:49,614
WTF?

185
00:09:49,614 --> 00:09:51,239
What Densha? What is going on?

186
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:53,605
He's gone crazy~~~!

187
00:09:53,605 --> 00:09:54,710
Which reply sent him mad?!

188
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,837
Because you guys were hurrying him to tell her

189
00:09:56,837 --> 00:09:58,455
Densha went mad!

190
00:09:58,455 --> 00:10:01,957
Densha, return normal!

191
00:10:01,957 --> 00:10:04,837
Hermes-san sent me her photo in sleeping clothes with photo mail drftgyhujiko

192
00:10:09,917 --> 00:10:12,628
Hey, it was just Hermes-san's photo?

193
00:10:12,628 --> 00:10:14,611
What was that bombing!

194
00:10:14,611 --> 00:10:16,572
Why are you attacking us! We are unarmed!

195
00:10:16,572 --> 00:10:19,492
Sleeping clothes? Pajamas? Negligee?

196
00:10:19,492 --> 00:10:20,484
Pajamas

197
00:10:20,484 --> 00:10:23,418
Me, worried about you? I feel so stupid

198
00:10:23,418 --> 00:10:25,833
Just confess or something, stupid asshole!

199
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,722
She is rolling around on her bed

200
00:10:28,722 --> 00:10:30,262
So cute~

201
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:37,542
Shit, I never wanted to see Hermes-san's face this bad

202
00:10:37,542 --> 00:10:39,679
Hey everyone, who are you imagining her as?

203
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,034
Nakatani Mikiro!

204
00:10:41,034 --> 00:10:44,145
Definitely, Baisho Michiko in her prime

205
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:45,701
No! No! It is Ooba Kumiko

206
00:10:45,701 --> 00:10:48,056
Ogura Yuko, or Yukorin~

207
00:10:48,056 --> 00:10:49,622
I was thinking of Kuninaka Ryoko-san

208
00:10:49,622 --> 00:10:52,160
You guys, you think such pretty girls would have Densha on their radar?

209
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,228
Geez, this is why an otaku's imagination is so disturbing

210
00:10:55,228 --> 00:10:57,938
But even more than anyone on television

211
00:10:57,938 --> 00:11:00,942
I like her

212
00:11:02,987 --> 00:11:07,940
I am... getting... mad...

213
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,221
Densha, I don't know what you are thinking...

214
00:11:11,221 --> 00:11:14,431
... but Hermes-san is not your girl yet

215
00:11:14,431 --> 00:11:15,057
Shhh!

216
00:11:15,057 --> 00:11:16,041
Well said

217
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,988
So hurry and get her

218
00:11:17,988 --> 00:11:20,566
Don't forget you were the one who saved her

219
00:11:20,566 --> 00:11:21,700
That's right

220
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,494
Even if she wants to say no, maybe she can't

221
00:11:24,494 --> 00:11:27,013
Chase after her and subdue her!

222
00:11:27,013 --> 00:11:28,380
Yeah...

223
00:11:30,075 --> 00:11:34,513
Of course. Sorry for being carried away OTL

224
00:11:34,513 --> 00:11:37,099
I should know where I stand

225
00:11:37,099 --> 00:11:41,320
This time, I am going to install the computer in her room

226
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,289
So I thought I could confess to her then

227
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:47,288
But never mind

228
00:11:47,288 --> 00:11:49,743
I am going to sleep. Good night

229
00:11:49,743 --> 00:11:50,928
Wait!!!

230
00:11:50,928 --> 00:11:52,630
What, her room?!

231
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,215
You should tell us something that important first!

232
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,409
More than that, don't give up on confessing!

233
00:11:57,409 --> 00:11:59,584
Sorry, we were bad to you!

234
00:11:59,584 --> 00:12:02,302
We were joking! Tell us when you are going!

235
00:12:02,302 --> 00:12:03,422
Densha! Don't sleep!

236
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:07,918
Reply~! Reply please! Reply~! Reply please!

237
00:12:07,918 --> 00:12:09,486
Densha (subway) can't depart!

238
00:12:10,912 --> 00:12:12,457
This way please

239
00:12:12,457 --> 00:12:15,470
Excuse me

240
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,428
Mom

241
00:12:16,428 --> 00:12:17,827
This is Yamada-san

242
00:12:17,827 --> 00:12:18,740
Welcome

243
00:12:28,445 --> 00:12:29,641
Saori

244
00:12:29,641 --> 00:12:31,417
Where is Yamada-san?

245
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,717
What?

246
00:12:32,717 --> 00:12:35,449
This is Yamada-san

247
00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:36,379
Hello

248
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:37,424
My name is Ya.Ya.Ya...Yamada

249
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:38,911
(Bark!)

250
00:12:44,066 --> 00:12:46,075
Saori

251
00:12:46,075 --> 00:12:48,328
Did you put on your contacts?

252
00:12:48,328 --> 00:12:49,983
Yes

253
00:12:49,983 --> 00:12:53,596
Then... that is a joke?

254
00:12:53,596 --> 00:12:57,283
To me.... more like... a weird... organism...

255
00:12:57,283 --> 00:12:59,308
You are being rude to Yamada-san

256
00:12:59,308 --> 00:13:01,794
Um... that...

257
00:13:01,794 --> 00:13:05,947
Why did I get my hopes up only to be disappointed

258
00:13:05,947 --> 00:13:06,940
Nice to meet you

259
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,126
Please come to my room

260
00:13:12,772 --> 00:13:13,830
Hello?

261
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,632
This is Aoyama spea...

262
00:13:20,532 --> 00:13:22,108
Please come in

263
00:13:25,108 --> 00:13:26,170
Is this

264
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,612
Aoyama-san's room?

265
00:13:28,612 --> 00:13:31,739
I will bring tea

266
00:13:31,739 --> 00:13:33,560
So please make yourself at home

267
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,079
Sure

268
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:46,599
Um...

269
00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:47,816
Yamada-san

270
00:13:47,816 --> 00:13:49,959
Looks like a good person

271
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:52,129
He has his charms

272
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:56,255
If you look at him right, he does look okay

273
00:13:56,255 --> 00:13:58,586
Your attitude is so different from a while ago

274
00:13:58,586 --> 00:13:59,588
Really?

275
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,729
Anyway

276
00:14:00,729 --> 00:14:01,975
This Sunday

277
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,908
Let's invite Yamada-san as a family

278
00:14:03,908 --> 00:14:05,882
And eat dinner together

279
00:14:05,882 --> 00:14:07,707
Why are you acting this way so suddenly?

280
00:14:09,707 --> 00:14:11,123
Smells good~

281
00:14:23,544 --> 00:14:25,814
Is anything wrong?

282
00:14:25,814 --> 00:14:28,632
No, nothing...

283
00:14:28,632 --> 00:14:30,724
This is a good computer

284
00:14:30,724 --> 00:14:32,019
Here

285
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:33,508
Thank you

286
00:14:33,508 --> 00:14:36,010
Can I help you with anything?

287
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,297
No, it will be done soon

288
00:14:38,297 --> 00:14:39,664
Please sit down and rest

289
00:14:39,664 --> 00:14:40,739
Really?

290
00:14:46,282 --> 00:14:48,552
These days...

291
00:14:48,552 --> 00:14:49,809
It's been hot, hasn't it?

292
00:14:49,809 --> 00:14:51,386
Yes

293
00:14:51,386 --> 00:14:54,962
I don't like summer that much

294
00:14:54,962 --> 00:14:56,539
Really?

295
00:14:56,539 --> 00:14:56,540


296
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:00,679
If the clothes are thin, I can't hide my figure

297
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:01,506
But

298
00:15:01,506 --> 00:15:03,446
Aoyama-san is skinny

299
00:15:03,446 --> 00:15:06,277
So I don't think there is any problem

300
00:15:06,277 --> 00:15:07,911
You said it

301
00:15:07,911 --> 00:15:08,360
Huh?

302
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,247
Friends and mom think

303
00:15:10,247 --> 00:15:11,590
Because I am so thin

304
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:14,643
I am not that attractive

305
00:15:14,643 --> 00:15:17,421
Ah, I see

306
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:19,116
Maybe because I am always like this

307
00:15:19,116 --> 00:15:20,816
I can't get a boyfriend?

308
00:15:20,816 --> 00:15:21,473


309
00:15:21,473 --> 00:15:23,745
What?

310
00:15:23,745 --> 00:15:26,078
You don't have a boyfriend?

311
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:28,433
No

312
00:15:28,433 --> 00:15:29,858
How about a fiance?

313
00:15:29,858 --> 00:15:31,011
What are you talking about?

314
00:15:33,971 --> 00:15:37,000
No boyfriend~

315
00:15:38,715 --> 00:15:42,389
FREE---!!!

316
00:15:47,853 --> 00:15:49,606
Are you okay?

317
00:15:49,606 --> 00:15:50,500
Oh, nothing

318
00:15:52,626 --> 00:15:53,699
But

319
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:55,184
I think...

320
00:15:55,184 --> 00:15:57,590
Regardless of your figure

321
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,157
Aoyama-san is great

322
00:15:59,157 --> 00:16:00,298
The guys around you

323
00:16:00,298 --> 00:16:02,692
Don't have the sense to see it

324
00:16:12,202 --> 00:16:13,856
Um....

325
00:16:13,856 --> 00:16:16,627
Please don't talk that way

326
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:31,117
[Confession]

327
00:16:31,117 --> 00:16:34,012
-Um... -Um...

328
00:16:34,012 --> 00:16:37,379
Aoyama-san first

329
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:41,295
Um... Actually...

330
00:16:41,295 --> 00:16:42,305
This Sunday

331
00:16:42,305 --> 00:16:45,265
Do you want to eat dinner with my family?

332
00:16:45,265 --> 00:16:48,174
Dinner?

333
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,244
Okay

334
00:16:49,244 --> 00:16:50,046
Then

335
00:16:50,046 --> 00:16:52,247
I will tell you the details later

336
00:16:52,247 --> 00:16:54,275
Okay

337
00:17:02,456 --> 00:17:05,659
With... Fa..family...?

338
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:06,876
What should I do?

339
00:17:06,876 --> 00:17:09,263
Now it is dinner with Hermes-san's family

340
00:17:09,263 --> 00:17:12,727
According to her, her father won't come

341
00:17:12,727 --> 00:17:16,103
Why did I ever say yes~ OTL

342
00:17:16,103 --> 00:17:18,105
It is punishment for making us wait

343
00:17:18,105 --> 00:17:19,956
Another trial before the confession

344
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:23,255
But, if her father won't be there, all we have to aim for is Hermes's mother

345
00:17:23,255 --> 00:17:26,414
I think you should make Hermes's mother satisfied with you

346
00:17:26,414 --> 00:17:28,767
Rich women will look at your appearance first

347
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:31,511
My mom is not rich, but she hates untidy men too

348
00:17:31,511 --> 00:17:32,996
That doesn't help!

349
00:17:32,996 --> 00:17:35,943
But still, you should be tidy

350
00:17:35,943 --> 00:17:38,601
How about my usual clean clothes?

351
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:41,605
If you are eating with her family, you should dress up

352
00:17:41,605 --> 00:17:44,317
Choosing suits rather reveals your sense

353
00:17:44,317 --> 00:17:45,417
Go in tuxedo

354
00:17:45,417 --> 00:17:48,528
Ask me about suits. I can talk about them for three hours!

355

If there is anything else you should be careful about when dining...

356
00:17:50,849 --> 00:17:53,324
Of course, are your table manners all right?

357
00:17:53,324 --> 00:17:56,848

361
00:18:03,518 --> 00:18:05,490
Conversation skills that make the dining enjoyable are also important

362
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,374
Go to a self-improving seminars!

363
00:18:07,374 --> 00:18:08,832
Read newspaper to keep up with current events

364
00:18:08,832 --> 00:18:11,420
Task at hand is suits, newspaper, table manners, and conversation

365
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,438
This flow... It's been a while! Want to do it again?

Um... Where did you buy those suits?

370
00:18:28,378 --> 00:18:31,775
With suits, giving good impression is more important than being trendy

371
00:18:31,775 --> 00:18:36,552
Rather than magazines, well-dressed people around you will be more helpful

Of course, I can't win against Oikawa-kun, hahaha

You can find a lot of well-dressed people among company superiors

Awesome!

382
00:19:00,628 --> 00:19:01,629
Of course

383
00:19:01,629 --> 00:19:04,903
Japanese suits are a little hard to wear

384
00:19:04,903 --> 00:19:06,130
That's right

385

391

Communication with Hermes's mother is important

But Densha's improving his conversation skills might be impossible

00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:35,745
Nobody hates complements

Don't hold the knife backwards

411
00:20:19,367 --> 00:20:21,803
Or make sounds when drinking soup

412

Only manners, but still manners!

413
00:20:24,814 --> 00:20:27,923
Um... Are you really okay?

414

If I don't do this much, I won't be able to remember in such short time

415
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,500
All right

416
00:20:35,824 --> 00:20:38,487
Start with the knife and fork on the outside

417
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,072
Okay

418

00:25:28,273 --> 00:25:29,952
Mother

515
00:25:29,952 --> 00:25:32,580
Explain what is going on

516
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,010
Mother

517
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:40,455
Even if I am getting a divorce with this man, I have nothing to say to him

518
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:42,731
That is why I told you guys to come

519
00:25:42,731 --> 00:25:44,294
What?

520
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:45,735
Why didn't you tell me?

521
00:25:45,735 --> 00:25:47,010
If I told you, you wouldn't have come

522
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,855
Of course not

523
00:25:48,855 --> 00:25:50,556
Yuki

524
00:25:50,556 --> 00:25:52,000
Did you bring it?

525
00:25:54,467 --> 00:25:57,665
Let's not talk about it here

526
00:25:57,665 --> 00:26:00,000
You are going to run away like that again?

527
00:26:01,507 --> 00:26:03,881
Then sign it now

528
00:26:06,581 --> 00:26:19,276
Stop it... not here

529
00:26:13,147 --> 00:26:15,000
Um....

530
00:26:16,551 --> 00:26:18,943
Who are you?

531
00:26:18,943 --> 00:26:21,163
Ah... Um... Um...

532
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:22,267
I... I am...

533
00:26:22,267 --> 00:26:23,714
Yamada Tsuyoshi-san

534
00:26:23,714 --> 00:26:26,296
My friend

535
00:26:26,296 --> 00:26:29,357
Oh? I am Saori's father

536
00:26:29,357 --> 00:26:31,000
Yes?

537
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,152
Sorry but

538
00:26:34,152 --> 00:26:36,397
We have important family business to talk about

539
00:26:36,397 --> 00:26:38,766
Can you leave now?

540
00:26:45,766 --> 00:26:47,006
Then

541
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:48,801
I will go back

542
00:26:48,801 --> 00:26:49,964
Sorry

543
00:26:49,964 --> 00:26:52,336
It's okay

544
00:26:52,336 --> 00:26:53,438
Thank you

545
00:26:53,438 --> 00:26:56,110
For today

546
00:27:10,475 --> 00:27:11,716
Um...

547
00:27:11,716 --> 00:27:15,613
I... have to go my next appointment

548
00:27:15,613 --> 00:27:17,882
Thank you

549
00:27:41,794 --> 00:27:43,718
It's been eight years now

550
00:27:43,718 --> 00:27:45,105
You said

551
00:27:45,105 --> 00:27:46,644
Until Keisuke graduates from college

552
00:27:46,644 --> 00:27:49,259
You wouldn't divorce

553
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:52,237
So I waited

554
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:53,785
Now it's fine, right?

555
00:27:58,127 --> 00:27:59,852
I have an appointment after this

556
00:27:59,852 --> 00:28:00,946
Can you hurry up?

557
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:02,514
Is that person waiting for you?

558
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,949
It's none of your business!

559
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:05,440
Mother, hurry up and do it

560
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,328
Be quiet, Keisuke

561
00:28:06,328 --> 00:28:07,235
If you don't make a decision here

562
00:28:07,235 --> 00:28:09,854
It will only harm the family

563
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,872
Because of mother and father

564
00:28:11,872 --> 00:28:13,801
My sister can't trust men anymore

565
00:28:13,801 --> 00:28:15,968
Keisuke

566
00:28:15,968 --> 00:28:18,514
Don't get us involved

567
00:28:18,514 --> 00:28:20,409
Is that so, Saori?

568
00:28:20,409 --> 00:28:21,903
What are you saying now!

569
00:28:21,903 --> 00:28:22,987
Shut up!

570
00:28:22,987 --> 00:28:25,748
Stop it, Keisuke

571
00:28:25,748 --> 00:28:31,145
Um...

572
00:28:31,145 --> 00:28:37,585
I forgot something...

573
00:28:37,585 --> 00:28:39,686
I am going back

574
00:28:39,686 --> 00:28:43,051
Hurry up and get it

575
00:28:43,051 --> 00:28:47,839
Sorry

576
00:29:01,603 --> 00:29:04,231
What now?

577
00:29:04,231 --> 00:29:05,514
N.. No...

578
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,646
Marriage is...

579
00:29:34,646 --> 00:29:39,614
Something so amazing

580
00:29:39,614 --> 00:29:41,603
Just dating someone

581
00:29:41,603 --> 00:29:46,292
Is such a huge thing for me

582
00:29:46,292 --> 00:29:48,001
But

583
00:29:48,001 --> 00:29:50,279
Proposing

584
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:53,738
Meeting each other's parents

585
00:29:53,738 --> 00:29:56,742
Buying a ring

586
00:29:56,742 --> 00:29:59,778
Having a wedding

587
00:29:59,778 --> 00:30:01,938
For sure,

588
00:30:01,938 --> 00:30:06,660
It is continual display of an unimagniable amount of courage

589
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,654
What are you trying to say?

590
00:30:07,654 --> 00:30:08,826
Be quiet

591
00:30:10,826 --> 00:30:12,761
Actually

592
00:30:12,761 --> 00:30:14,504
Even I

593
00:30:14,504 --> 00:30:19,376
Do not know what I am saying

594
00:30:22,376 --> 00:30:25,500
Just

595
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,734
I don't want to see

596
00:30:26,734 --> 00:30:31,656
Aoyama-san's sad face

597
00:30:31,656 --> 00:30:33,610
Also I

598
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:39,440
Have a father and a mother

599
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,134
They are different from Aoyama-san's

600
00:30:42,134 --> 00:30:45,737
That it is hard to lean on father

601
00:30:45,737 --> 00:30:51,460
And mother is frequently not home

602
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:54,085
Even then

603
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:55,071
They...

604
00:30:55,071 --> 00:30:57,982
Always smile

605
00:30:57,982 --> 00:30:59,699
Because of useless things

606
00:30:59,699 --> 00:31:03,832
As if they were stupid

607
00:31:03,832 --> 00:31:05,799
So...

608
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:07,225
Even I...

609
00:31:07,225 --> 00:31:11,968
Relax and smile with them

610
00:31:14,968 --> 00:31:16,901
Children want

611
00:31:16,901 --> 00:31:18,320
Their parents

612
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,043
To smile

613
00:31:21,043 --> 00:31:23,578
Definitely

614
00:31:23,578 --> 00:31:26,023
Even more than anyone

615
00:31:26,023 --> 00:31:33,286
They wish for their parents to be happy

616
00:31:33,286 --> 00:31:36,089
So

617
00:31:36,089 --> 00:31:38,084
Always

618
00:31:38,084 --> 00:31:40,935
They want their parents to be smiling

619
00:31:48,579 --> 00:31:49,536
For some reason...

620
00:31:49,536 --> 00:31:51,045
Sorry

621
00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:04,062
Here

622
00:32:04,062 --> 00:32:05,896
Divorce papers

623
00:32:05,896 --> 00:32:08,282
I even signed it already

624
00:32:08,282 --> 00:32:10,208
Yuki

625
00:32:12,494 --> 00:32:14,113
All right.

626
00:32:37,479 --> 00:32:42,808
Mother

627
00:32:42,808 --> 00:32:46,135
I think now I can understand a little bit

628
00:32:46,135 --> 00:32:51,734
Why you chose him

629
00:32:51,734 --> 00:32:52,843
Let's go

630
00:32:58,507 --> 00:33:59,500
Saori

631
00:33:05,132 --> 00:33:07,248
Sorry

632
00:33:13,248 --> 00:33:16,000
Father

633
00:33:20,295 --> 00:33:22,480
See you again

634
00:33:47,653 --> 00:33:49,442
I lost

635
00:33:49,442 --> 00:33:52,061
Densha Otoko

636
00:33:56,637 --> 00:34:58,500
Um...

637
00:34:01,968 --> 00:34:02,918
Hands....

638
00:34:02,918 --> 00:34:06,551
You want to hold hands?

639
00:34:06,551 --> 00:34:11,772
Sure

640
00:34:25,999 --> 00:34:28,109
It went something like this

641
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:30,701
Good job! I feel like crying! Densha!

642
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:32,563
Is Densha's mobilesuit a monster!?

643
00:34:32,563 --> 00:34:34,481
Renewal Project was all useless

644
00:34:34,481 --> 00:34:36,083
If the ending is good, all is good!

645
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:38,084
Looks like you left a good impression with Hermes-san's mother

646
00:34:38,084 --> 00:34:39,325
Mission cleared!

647
00:34:39,325 --> 00:34:40,748
So your blind spot is gone now

648
00:34:40,748 --> 00:34:41,666
Now it is the confession! For real!

649
00:34:41,666 --> 00:34:42,998
This is getting big!

650
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:43,891
Talking about getting big,

651
00:34:43,891 --> 00:34:46,212
This forum also became quite famous

652
00:34:46,212 --> 00:34:47,856
Yeah, there are more people involved now

653
00:34:47,856 --> 00:34:50,438
It is only natural for people to be attracted to interesting things

654
00:34:50,438 --> 00:34:53,224
Oh, I overheard some high school girls talking about this forum in the subway

655
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:55,132
I was also surprised that my friend knew about it

656
00:34:55,132 --> 00:34:57,541
Now we are famous!

657
00:34:57,541 --> 00:34:59,992
But if it gets bigger and bigger

658
00:34:59,992 --> 00:35:02,779
Hermes-san might find out about this forum

659
00:35:13,704 --> 00:35:16,216
There is a possibility that Hermes-san's friend might find out about it

660
00:35:16,216 --> 00:35:18,137
BbrrrrrrRRRRR

661
00:35:18,137 --> 00:35:20,664
What do you think, Densha?

662
00:35:20,664 --> 00:35:23,307
I don't think it is a problem...

663
00:35:23,307 --> 00:35:25,401
"No don't say anything!" trying to upset him

664
00:35:25,401 --> 00:35:27,205
How are you so optimistic?

665
00:35:27,205 --> 00:35:29,146
This is where all your inner thoughts are

666
00:35:29,146 --> 00:35:32,985
"It smelled good" "Age = years without a girlfriend"

667
00:35:32,985 --> 00:35:35,236
All your bizarre statements are here too

668
00:35:35,236 --> 00:35:36,588
"Where should I go for food?"

669
00:35:36,588 --> 00:35:40,000
Things we talked through together are also here!

670
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,958
My Hermes-san moe will be known too

671
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:44,435
Us 'Anonymous' are fine~

672
00:35:44,435 --> 00:35:47,964
Densha, Your "Haa~ Haa~" will also be known!

673
00:35:47,964 --> 00:35:49,809
Don't scare me like that OTL

674
00:35:49,809 --> 00:35:50,734
Hey Densha

675
00:35:50,734 --> 00:35:52,701
This is quite a serious problem

676
00:35:52,701 --> 00:35:55,015
If you get caught, you will for sure be hated

677
00:35:55,015 --> 00:35:56,610
Even Hermes-san won't appreciate

678
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:57,671
Her story being widely known

679
00:35:57,671 --> 00:36:01,375
As a woman, if I am talked about where I don't know

680
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:02,615
I might dislike it

681
00:36:02,615 --> 00:36:05,903
That is an honest opinion

682
00:36:05,903 --> 00:36:08,151
Holding hands or going on a first date...

683
00:36:08,151 --> 00:36:10,984
To a woman, they would want them to be kept as a secret between the two

684
00:36:10,984 --> 00:36:14,203
To have what I said casually all recorded somewhere...

685
00:36:14,203 --> 00:36:15,323
... ruins everything

686
00:36:15,323 --> 00:36:18,935
How about when she confided in only you? Like the stalker story?

687
00:36:18,935 --> 00:36:22,249
She will cry if she see that on the internet

688
00:36:22,249 --> 00:36:25,901
Misunderstandings like "surfing" and mistakes being known will also be tough on her

689
00:36:25,901 --> 00:36:28,862
If you look at it from a different approach, it will be like opening up her privacy

690
00:36:28,862 --> 00:36:30,512
Scrutinized completely

691
00:36:30,512 --> 00:36:33,022
I thought about it after all of your replies

692
00:36:33,022 --> 00:36:36,141
This might be a betrayal toward Hermes-san

[Betrayal]

694
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,973
Betrayal...

695
00:36:40,973 --> 00:36:44,029
I never even thought about it

696
00:36:44,029 --> 00:36:47,863
Did I betray Hermes-san?

697
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:13,693
Well, these are all "if"s, so don't worry too much

698
00:37:13,693 --> 00:37:16,775
Can we decide that these are only "if"s? Nope! Can't do that!

699
00:37:16,775 --> 00:37:19,193
It will be better if you tell her before she finds out

700
00:37:19,193 --> 00:37:22,593
Densha, if you feel guilty, better to tell her

701
00:37:22,593 --> 00:37:24,038
If you tell her, she will hate you

702
00:37:27,808 --> 00:37:31,044
There is less than one percent chance that she will find out

703
00:37:31,044 --> 00:37:32,661
If she never finds out, it won't be a betrayal

704
00:37:32,661 --> 00:37:34,804
I think if you tell her carefully, she will understand

705
00:37:34,804 --> 00:37:38,118
If I were Hermes-san... Sex, I mean end of friendship!

706
00:37:38,118 --> 00:37:40,854
Hermes-san will be internet-shocked to death

707
00:37:40,854 --> 00:37:42,365
When this forum is revealed

708
00:37:42,365 --> 00:37:46,326
Densha's hope of going to the World Cup is gone~ Benoist~!

709
00:37:46,326 --> 00:37:47,718
This is singles' headquarters

710
00:37:47,718 --> 00:37:49,494
Densha, save the Earth!

711
00:37:49,494 --> 00:37:52,358
Hey Densha, are you listening?

712

713
00:38:13,664 --> 00:38:16,527
I tried everything...

714
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:20,970
But I think I can't go back there

715
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:22,532
Bye bye

Wait a second...

719

Is this small tank-like piece the heart of the probelm?

720
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:42,040
Wait for me, Densha!

721
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,522
All right. It's this! This one!

722
00:38:45,522 --> 00:38:47,563
Where does this go?

723
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:54,544
Wait... what are you doing?

724
00:38:54,544 --> 00:38:55,398
This...

725
00:38:55,398 --> 00:38:56,597
No...

726
00:38:56,597 --> 00:38:57,801
What is going on?

727
00:38:57,801 --> 00:38:58,994
What are you talking about?

728
00:38:58,994 --> 00:39:01,577
Why are they talking about my sister?

729
00:39:02,577 --> 00:39:03,983
Did you do it?

730
00:39:03,983 --> 00:39:06,192
No, I couldn't have done it!

731
00:39:06,192 --> 00:39:08,338
Then...

732
00:39:08,338 --> 00:39:10,921
Yamada did this

733
00:39:10,921 --> 00:39:12,907
You came to me

734
00:39:12,907 --> 00:39:14,258
To spy on my sister?

735
00:39:14,258 --> 00:39:15,967
No, it's not that

736
00:39:15,967 --> 00:39:18,529
Yes, you deliberately did it

737
00:39:18,529 --> 00:39:20,808
Damn it

738
00:39:20,808 --> 00:39:22,133

We are not trying to scare you

If you tell Hermes-san about this forum, it will be like committing suicide

741
00:39:49,038 --> 00:39:51,772
Densha, we are giving you advice for your sake

742
00:39:51,772 --> 00:39:54,079
We don't want to see you getting hurt

743
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,394
No, if you tell her, that is the end of the world

744
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,110
Can you give up all your hard work you put in?

745
00:40:04,721 --> 00:40:06,680
We are fine with being singles all our lives

Whether you were betraying her or not

752
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:30,763
Depends on how you look at all this

753

"What did this forum mean to me?"

757
00:40:37,688 --> 00:40:39,931
And find an answer

758

On this forum...

765

I have written
