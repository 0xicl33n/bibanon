1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,750
What happened?  You look angry.

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,690
You've been played by that guy Yamada.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,800
That bastard...

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,940
has been writing about you on the Net.

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,600
He wrote about the day you met him, and your trauma.

6
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,510
He's been laughing at you, having a great time.

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,290
Oh, no.  It can't be.

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,980
What a bastard.

9
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,620
He totally stabbed you in the back.

10
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,010
Look.

11
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:31,420
The stalker, Mom and Dad's divorce,
and other private things...

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,220
It's here for the whole world to see!

13
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:33,970
Stop it!

14
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:38,360
That's not all. He fantasizes about you
in some twisted kind of way.

15
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,970
Saori, Yamada-san is at the door!

16
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,600
That bastard.

17
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,380
Keisuke!

18
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,510
Good morning.

19
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,010
Wh-What?

20
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,640
You wrote about my sister on the Net!

21
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,590
What?

22
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,500
Keisuke, stop!

23
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,690
Let me talk to him.

24
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,350
I just heard about the board.

25
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,040
Did you really write about me there?

26
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,540
W-well..That...

27
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,820
So it was true.

28
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,060
A-actually, that's the reason I'm here-

29
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,060
Did you enjoy it?

30
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:37,980
What?

31
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:42,530
Joking and laughing about me...

32
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,860
..did you enjoy it?

33
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,000
That was never my intent.

34
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:54,270
I went on that board because I had no idea
how to date women...

35
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:59,820
I don't want to hear it.
I was a fool to believe you.

36
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,260
Please...

37
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,030
don't come here anymore.

38
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,160
Wait!

39
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,300
You and my sister live in two different worlds.

40
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:36,370
Wait, honey, stop!

41
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:41,590
It's not like I dated her.  We were just talking.

42
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,530
You okay?

43
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,280
No, I'm not okay.

44
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,920
Dumb question.

45
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,640
SHUT UP!

46
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,130
It's fixed!  It's fixed!

47
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,850
Densha!

48
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,540
I'm back!

49
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,650
I've been completely rejected by Hermes.

50
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:18,700
This time, it's really over.

51
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,030
What, what?  What happened?

52
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,380
Details!

53

Special thanks to chiisana_tantei
for providing the episode raw file.

55
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,440
I told you not to tell her about the board!

56
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,750
It's what he decided to do, it can't be helped now.

57
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,630
I should have stopped him!  Stupid me!

58
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,960
So the reason she rejected you is
because you told her about this board?

59
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:13,900
She already knew about it by the time I got there.
Somehow her brother found out and told her.

60
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,040
She found out BEFORE you told her?

61
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,010
Damn the brother!

62
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:19,230
Who would have guessed someone that
close to her would know about us...

63
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,510
Well, even a junior high school kid
like me is in this chatroom...

64
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,260
Who made this board so popular?!

65
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,730
It's all of us, honey...

66
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,000
Sorry, Mom...

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,980
Does that mean Hermes is reading this right now?

68
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,720
Wow, just that thought made
me sit up straighter!

69
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,830
Hermes!  Wait, I need to change clothes!

70
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,550
There's little chance of that.

71
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:43,600
Both Hermes and her brother
seemed offended by this board.

72
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,380
If they have that kind of bias,
there is nothing you can do.

73
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,240
I'd say that's a pretty normal
way for girls to look at us...

74
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,710
That's a relief!  But also a shame...

75
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,590
Well, this way, at least we can keep writing
the way we normally do...

76
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,420
Why did she reject you
without even looking at this board?

77
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,590
I'm sure she was shocked that I was
talking about her without her knowledge.

78
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:06,830
She wanted to end it
without listening to my excuses.

79
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,970
So if you just clear up her misunderstanding,
things will work out, right?

80
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,000
That's what you were planning
to do in the first place!

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,490
Don't give up now!

82
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:13,990
Keep talking to her till she understands!

83
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,460
Time to go back to Hermes' house!

84
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,460
I can't.

85
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:23,100
Her brother told me that Hermes
and I live in different worlds...

86
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:28,070
..meaning I have no business dating
a girl like her.

87
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,560
Even if I could somehow get her to
understand about this board...

88
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,450
Satisfying her to the point where
we could be in love again...

89
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:37,970
..is impossible.

90
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,190
I thought all I had to do to go out
with her was stop being a nerd, but actually...

91
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:46,000
It's painfully clear to me now that making an
effort for her not to hate me...

92
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,350
..is not the same as making an effort for her to like me.

93
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,130
She told me not to come near her anymore...

94
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,930
..and I think it has finally sunk in.

95
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:03,340
She and I...are finished.

96
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:07,870
Hey!  Are you ok with that?!

97
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:11,340
Don't give up!  Keep trying!

98
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:14,440
We're still behind you!

99
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:35,790
Ok, you've done enough.  You were amazing.

100
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,170
At first, I made fun of you. You were so hopeless
when it came to just calling her to say "thank you".

101
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:46,655
That made me feel like we all had to support you...

102
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:50,600
...but you are way ahead of me now.

103
00:06:50,635 --> 00:06:55,944
If a guy like you thinks it's really over,
 I guess you are right.


104
00:06:56,576 --> 00:06:59,919
You really were amazing.  Good job.

105
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:07,070
I'm sure that our words don't mean anything
 to a brave guy like you.

106
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:10,070
This time, it's more complicated
than just a little lie...

107
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:13,200
Well, don't worry.  You will find someone else.

108
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,250
No, no!  I can't accept this!

109
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,360
Densha, welcome back to the fold.

110
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,970
Densha!...the end...

111
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,500
Oh man...I'm just a newbie,
but I was on standby making shelters!

112
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,660
Me too!  Me too!

113
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,750
Come on, try again!

114
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,020
Good job.  You've given us courage.

115
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,600
Thanks to you, I'll probably
fail my exam again this year.

116
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,660
Anyway, just put on some muscle!

117
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,540
This has been like the World Cup!
Thank you! Benoist!

118
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,430
Last Stop!  Last Stop!

119
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:44,230
I'm sure you'll find
a wonderful person soon!

120
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:47,560
Don't worry!
I got dumped 15 times in a row!

121
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm sorry, Densha-san.

122
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,590
These 3 months are something
 I'll always keep with me.

123
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:06,630
This is probably the last time I'll write here.
I won't forget you guys...

124
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,880
...Thank you all so much.

125
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,620
Nothing to look forward to again.

126
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:05,980
Matsunaga, Matsunaga, Matsunaga, Matsunaga...

127
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,140
That sea turtle?

128
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,640
Right, but he wasn't just any sea turtle.

129
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,280
He's a totally rich sea turtle!

130
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,750
His family owns a lot of land in Nagoya...

131
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,270
He makes $300,000 a year without working!
Can you believe it?

132
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,360
Talk about finding a diamond in the rough!

133
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,100
Here, here!  Look, look!

134
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:26,350
Those cool eyebrows, those mysterious bangs,
you can see "heir" written on his face!

135
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,150
You're seriously going after Turtle-boy?

136
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,540
After I get back from Italy,
I promised I'd date him!

137
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,150
Don't you have any pride?

138
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,510
Of course not, pride went out the window
when I turned 30!

139
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,700
I'm sorry.

140
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,480
What's wrong?

141
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,480
Saori, you're never late.

142
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,610
Here you go, the ticket to Italy.

143
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,860
What's wrong?  Have you been crying?

144
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,860
Something happen with Yamada again?

145
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:53,410
I've decided not to see Yamada-san anymore.

146
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:54,690
What?

147
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,740
This time, we're really finished.

148
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,520
What do you mean?

149
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,460
What's wrong with him?

150
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,400
He said he completely lost a fight
for the love of a girl.

151
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:10,040
Hey, is it true that Yamada and Saori broke up?

152
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,700
What?  Broke up?

153
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,510
It's not like they were really dating.

154
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,519
What the hell is he doing now?

155
00:11:16,386 --> 00:11:18,424
Don't you know how much effort
 I put into stopping you?

156
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,770
Wait...that means she's free!

157
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,490
Time to make up for lost time!

158
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:32,660
Hey, tell me what happened.
Saori won't talk about it.

159
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,150
Listen...can we talk?

160
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,150
You told your sister about the board, right?  Why?

161
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,950
I just told her the facts.

162
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,170
Then tell me what the facts are.

163
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,270
Did I stutter?  TELL ME THE FACTS.

164
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,350
Wow, you've totally changed!

165
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,270
This is the REAL me.

166
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:12,600
He talked about my sister, making fun of her.

167
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,680
Did you actually READ it?

168
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,680
Why would I?

169
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,280
Unbelievable.  This is why I can't stand KIDS.

170
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,370
What does that mean?

171
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,250
Read the damn board!

172
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:32,520
What was that?  What did she mean by the board?

173
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:36,740
Sorry.  Misuzu-san!

174
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39,240
On Aladdin Channel...

175
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,320
You will find... How Saori and Yamada...

176
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:47,480
Broke up, baby...

177
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,900
Serves him right! Yay!

178
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:55,620
I know it's business, but we're going to Italy,
and it should be a nice change of pace, right?

179
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,610
Sorry, I drank too much last night!

180
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:01,890
You're late!

181
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,890
Let's go!

182
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:10,740
Stupid Yamada!  This makes 3 days in a row!

183
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,520
Ok, he's fired, he's fired, he's fired!

184
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:22,400
Hello, this is Yamada's boss, is he home?

185
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,400
Yes, yes, I expect his resignation..yes, yes.

186
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,870
Oh, someone hung up!

187
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,480
What's wrong, Oikawa-kun?

188
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,420
I...don't dislike Yamada.

189
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,800
Well, whether you like him or not,
you'll need to go along with my decisions.

190
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,610
I'm sorry you feel that way.

191
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,080
Wh-wha-what?

192
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:51,130
Yes?  Jinnkama-san...why-?

193
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,180
Get me some tea.

194
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,180
Huh?

195
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,370
She dumped you?

196
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:01,700
How did you-?

197
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,530
Oh, just a rumor...

198
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:05,530
I see.

199
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:10,280
Anyway, it's not like she would date a guy like you...

200
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:18,350
Come on...a nerd and a princess...
we're talking about Beauty and the Beast here.

201
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:28,628
Oh, I can't stand this kind of sentimental BS!

202
00:14:29,216 --> 00:14:30,229
Take it off!

203
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,230
Huh?

204
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:35,650
I feel some responsibility for this,
so...this is the only way.

205
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,840
The cure for a broken heart
 is to find someone new, right?

206
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,450
What are you doing?

207
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:44,030
Be quiet. Hold still.

208
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,330
Please, stop it.

209
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,750
How long do you plan to stay hurt?

210
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,410
There are plenty of women like that out there.

211
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,270
No, there aren't!

212
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:58,710
There aren't any other women like her.

213
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:05,570
Are you saying I'm not good enough?
Let me show you something!

214
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,810
Hello!

215
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,360
Hello.

216
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,890
Excuse us!

217
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:32,040
What are you doing?

218
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,850
Oh, just a second.

219
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,180
That looks good!

220
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,560
Ok, I think I understand now.

221
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:55,660
Due to unfortunate circumstances,
I was away from this board for awhile.

222
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,610
It seems that somehow Densha
has had his heart broken.

223
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,240
That's right.  Oh, I'm sleepy.

224
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,570
There's almost no one left on this board now.

225
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,770
There's no reason to stay, with Densha gone.

226
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:12,150
Why did you guys let him quit?
He's not going to change if this goes on.

227
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,590
Densha decided it was over on his own.

228
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:20,090
He developed into a super weapon.

229
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,950
And now he's gone.

230
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:24,476
I know he's been hurt.

231
00:16:24,477 --> 00:16:28,720
But we were supposed to make sure
 his dream of falling in love came true!

232
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,750
Who do you think you are?
We are all fully aware of that.

233
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,490
We have to accept that some
things in the world are not meant to be.

234
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:37,520
We did what we could.

235
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,350
It's not like I'm guaranteeing we'll succeed.

236
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:46,870
But I don't want his feelings to linger.
He never told her, did he?

237
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:50,310
He could at least do that before he gives up.

238
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:54,000
It's too late.

239
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,390
Densha said he'd never come back here.

240
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:01,250
This is the only way we have to contact him.

241
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,080
That kind of thinking is the reason we are losers.

242
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,880
If we can't change ourselves, 
how can we hope to encourage Densha?

243
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:14,270
Let's get him back to this board, and
get him to tell Hermes how he feels about her!

244
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,840
This pep talk won't work.

245
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:26,560
It bothers me too!  But Densha said...

246
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,230
Count me in.

247
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,450
Hey, hey...you're just going to hurt Densha again.

248
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:35,220
NO!!  Saying we didn't want to hurt him
was just an excuse for us to take the easy way out.

249
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,640
Densha is our ultimate weapon.

250
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,690
Come on, guys.  He's had enough.

251
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:44,100
Have you guys forgotten what havoc
this will wreak on his life?

252
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,410
Well, if we can't support him, then who can?

253
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,710
Anyone who doesn't want to
support Densha can leave.

254
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:52,460
You guys...are so crazy!

255
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,790
Back to work, fellas - Cheers!

256
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:58,420
Let's inject Densha with some "loser guy" power!

257
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,700
Soldiers!  We need a strategy!

258
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:05,640
Obviously, there is a high probability Densha will go to
Akihabara tomorrow since he is so dejected.

259
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,030
That means we need to scour Akihabara for him.

260
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:11,520
Densha said that he lives on the Chuo Line,
so I'll wait for him at the station.

261
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,020
I'll make an announcement at the station!

262
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,580
I'll do a live performance there.

263
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,380
I'll go to Central Akihabara and start
yelling "Densha"!

264
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,460
I'll call out for him at 3000 feet!

265
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,630
I'll publish a book about him!

266
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,240
I'll call out for him too!

267
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,540
Then I will buy up Akihabara itself while I look for him.

268
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,980
I'll set traps for him
at other boards to bring him back.

269
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:34,810
You guys are amazing.  Doing all this for someone else.

270
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:40,220
I bet if I'd had friends like you around me,
my life would have been more fun.

271
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:44,780
What are you talking about?  We're your friends too.

272
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:50,550
Anytime you have a problem, you know you can talk to us.

273
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:15,080
I haven't left my room in ages, but I'm going
to put up notices for Densha all over Akihabara.

274
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,550
That might just work.
Make sure to get permission!

275
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,770
Ok, I'll get on TV and see what I can do.

276
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:23,490
Alright!  Let's get him back here!

277
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,690
Time to make those notices.

278
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:33,460
(Station Names)Inage, Tsudanuma, Funabashi, Ichikawa,
Shin-Koiwa, Kinshichou, Bakurochou...

279
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,490
Dad, who is Densha Otoko?

280
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,770
It's better not to ask.

281
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,680
Oh, it's the Oracle!

282
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,150
You know him?

283
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,150
Yeah, he teaches me all
the tricks on games.

284
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,290
Really?

285
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:48,730
That reminds me, I memorized the Nambu line.

286
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:49,620
Let's hear 'em.

287
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,840
Tachikawa, Nishi-kunitachi, Yaho-

288
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,000
Nope! After Nishi-kunitachi,
we stop at Yagawa!

289
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:01,280
Tachikawa, Nishi-kunitachi, Yagawa, Yaho...

290
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,290
Scary!

291
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:14,290
And Sunny!

292
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:19,450
-Pardon me, pardon me...
-Excuse me, pardon me...

[Densha Otoko-San Come Back]

294
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:31,780
Densha-san, don't give up...

295
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,877
Even if you have a broken heart...

296
00:21:34,912 --> 00:21:36,989
One more time...

297
00:21:36,989 --> 00:21:39,130
Take a look at the board!

298
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:48,710
Would you like to hold hands?

299
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,960
H-h-here you go.

300
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:15,380
Ho, ho! How rude! We run into each other,
and all I get is a sigh!

301
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:20,630
Matsunaga-shi, holding hands with a guy
is a little suspicious, don't you think?

302
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:24,210
Get out of here!  I have a girlfriend now!

303
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,650
A girlfriend?

304
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:32,090
Yamada-shi, it's been a while
since we hung out, hasn't it?

305
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:40,330
[Densha Otoko - Tell her!]

306
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,490
Densha!  Densha!

307
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:59,180
This is Mina!  See you next time!

308
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:19,080
Densha-kun!  Too bad that while you're wasting time,
my lethal weapon has reached its target.

309
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,630
Oh! What a handsome man!

310
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:34,150
Broken-hearted Saori...will be unable to
refuse her mother's strong advice...

311
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,500
I was a little surprised to hear about
your interest in me for an arranged marriage...

312
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:49,550
I was surprised too.  I can't believe you were Hermes.
I'll make sure and thank Densha.

313
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:51,940
Thanks to him, you and I will be even closer.

314
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,800
Pardon?

315
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,630
Look over there.

316
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:09,040

00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,900
This is the final train, Densha!

469
00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:01,690
Don't worry about how it turns out.
I'm sure you'll feel better after telling her how you feel.

470
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,450
I'll get a shelter ready, just in case.

471
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:05,450
Benoist!

472
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:07,690
Finally, the day has come!

473
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:10,030
It's been awhile since we got this excited!

474
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:12,020
A guy can really change in 3 months!

475
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:14,600
You can have all my positive energy!

476
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,430
Oh, I'm in tears!

477
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:21,270
I'm not crying yet.
I'm holding it in till you come back!

478
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:27,700
Densha, we're not just connected through electronic signals.
We're connected through our hearts.

479
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:46,270
Guys, thank you for these 3 months.
I don't know if it was long or short, real or just a dream...

480
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:53,040
To be honest, I feel uneasy.

481
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:58,450
I'll do what I must.

482
00:41:00,278 --> 00:41:06,237
I think the course of my future will be determined today.

483
00:41:10,697 --> 00:41:14,331
But I'm done with my old, dark way of life!

484
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:23,530
Your support has made all the difference.
One way or another, things will finally be settled!

485
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:38,150
[The World is Here Waiting for the Two of You]

486
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:06,730
Thank you.  Ok, I'm heading out!

487
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:42,240
Going somewhere?

488
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,390
I'm starting a new life.

489
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:50,890
After getting that divorce,
the world has opened up for me.

490
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:53,430
That's not what you said before.

491
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:55,900
I have Yamada-san to thank for that.

492
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:59,860
Saori,

493
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:04,060
If you have love,
you can overcome anything.

494
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,780
Tuna Cans-Check!

495
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:51,240
Good work, Densha-kun.
Too bad you're a step behind me.

496
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,760
You're about to see a complete reversal of fortune.

497
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,620
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

498
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:02,980
I'm Aoyama Yuki.

499
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,980
I'm Sakurai.

500
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,720
And Saori-san?

501
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,330
She's not coming.

502
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,220
But today's meeting is for-

503
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,220
Me.

504
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,690
Oh, that's funny.

505
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:48,530
P-p-please take a look at the board.
My whole life is written there.

506
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:55,190
P-p-please.  Read all the messages.
  At the end, you'll see a message-
