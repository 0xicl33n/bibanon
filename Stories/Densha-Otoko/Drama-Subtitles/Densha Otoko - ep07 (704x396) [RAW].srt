1
00:00:17,728 --> 00:00:21,014
Didn't you have work?

2
00:00:22,127 --> 00:00:24,577
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:28,967
To be honest, I was surprised.

4
00:00:31,505 --> 00:00:33,313
Yes.

5
00:00:33,831 --> 00:00:36,711
So you were..

6
00:00:39,961 --> 00:00:42,714
lying to me.

7
00:00:46,751 --> 00:00:49,176
I thought I could finally...

8
00:00:52,484 --> 00:00:54,469
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:56,507 --> 00:00:58,722
I...

10
00:01:00,304 --> 00:01:03,130
At such an important time...

11
00:01:03,471 --> 00:01:06,007
I...

12
00:01:06,561 --> 00:01:10,365
I believed you...

13
00:01:13,437 --> 00:01:17,219
_         Love
Sunday   PC   Aoyama-san / Yamada Tsuyoshi

14
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:29,077
This guy...

15
00:01:29,077 --> 00:01:32,157
Woa, what an Otaku.

16
00:01:32,157 --> 00:01:38,196
I don't think we should see each other any more.

17
00:01:39,518 --> 00:01:41,482
Bye.

18
00:01:49,256 --> 00:01:51,220
Um...

19
00:02:10,132 --> 00:02:12,110
So that,

20
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,253
was Densha and Hermes.

21
00:02:24,087 --> 00:02:27,721
Were you able to meet him?

22
00:02:30,244 --> 00:02:32,489
Do you want a ride?

23
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,211
Ankle Princess              _

24
00:02:47,815 --> 00:02:51,695
I wonder why Men have to always lie.

25
00:02:55,344 --> 00:02:57,169
Aren't you drinking too much?

26
00:02:57,169 --> 00:02:58,971
It's ok.

27
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,679
Is it?

28
00:03:02,033 --> 00:03:06,380
I wonder why I can't forgive those lies.

29
00:03:15,151 --> 00:03:17,519
I too scared now...

30
00:03:18,612 --> 00:03:19,821
You know,

31
00:03:21,686 --> 00:03:24,128
Saori?

32
00:03:27,154 --> 00:03:31,132
Did her cup size change?

33
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:53,932
Tsuyoshi.

34
00:03:54,488 --> 00:03:56,946
Say something when you get back.

35
00:03:59,993 --> 00:04:02,381
Enter Message

36
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:25,388
[So tomorrow Densha tells her how he feels.]

37
00:04:25,423 --> 00:04:27,374
[So this is it then.  It really makes you think.]

38
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:30,271
[Let's all send him off in a big way.]

39
00:04:40,872 --> 00:04:44,072
So Saori's Hermes.

40
00:04:45,512 --> 00:04:48,201
Right now,

41
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,521
the Angel and the Devil are fighting inside of me.

42
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,120
Hey, hey, what are you thinking of?

43
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,312
This is the girl you've looked after like a sister!

44
00:04:57,529 --> 00:04:58,793
Idiot!

45
00:04:58,793 --> 00:05:01,873
The girl in front of you is Hermes.

46
00:05:01,873 --> 00:05:04,981
"I'm holding on"?  THAT Hermes.

47
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,489
Saori's looked up to you like an older brother.

48
00:05:07,489 --> 00:05:08,618
She'll lose faith!

49
00:05:08,858 --> 00:05:09,721
Get real.

50
00:05:09,721 --> 00:05:12,537
"I was leading you that way from the beginning"?  That's Hermes.

51
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,330
Don't listen to what this guy is saying.

52
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:14,790
Take her home.

53
00:05:14,966 --> 00:05:15,847
Shut up already.

54
00:05:15,847 --> 00:05:17,367
Get lost.

55
00:05:21,408 --> 00:05:23,743
Sorry, good me.

56
00:05:33,605 --> 00:05:36,375
Wow, look at the time!

57
00:05:36,465 --> 00:05:38,480
What a dream.

58
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,897
I'm sorry I fell asleep.

59
00:05:40,897 --> 00:05:42,000
No, it's ok.

60
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,216
I changed back into an angel again.

61
00:05:43,216 --> 00:05:44,551
Do you want a ride back?

62
00:05:52,097 --> 00:05:56,017
I got dumped by Hermes-san today.

63
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:05,770
What happened?  Weren't you supposed to meet her tomorrow?

64
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,882
Why? Why? Why?

65
00:06:07,882 --> 00:06:11,059
G, g, give us the details.

66
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:15,485
Hermes came to Comike to bring me something I lost.

67
00:06:16,231 --> 00:06:20,032
And that's when she saw me in full Otaku mode.

68
00:06:20,032 --> 00:06:24,406
Then she suddenly started crying.

69
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:25,736
It's The End.

70
00:06:25,736 --> 00:06:27,096
That's why I told you not to go to Comike!

71
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:31,041
It's just what we feared!! Shiver, shiver.

72
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,633
Why do women hate Otakus!

73
00:06:33,633 --> 00:06:36,264
That even Hermes can't accept Otakus;

74
00:06:36,264 --> 00:06:37,072
Les Miserables

75
00:06:37,072 --> 00:06:39,000
Would she cry just because of that?

76
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,899
I thought so too.  

77
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:41,749
A prejudice wouldn't cause her to cry.

78
00:06:41,807 --> 00:06:43,201
It could be there's another reason.

79
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:47,265
They say a women's heart is as fickle as the sea.

80
00:06:47,265 --> 00:06:49,201
It's because you lied about work.

81
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:51,553
It's because you were drooling over those cosplay girls.

82
00:06:51,553 --> 00:06:54,323
She was definitely shocked that you were an Otaku.

83
00:06:54,323 --> 00:06:55,705
I'm clueless.

84
00:06:55,705 --> 00:06:57,281
The mystery just deepens.

85
00:06:57,281 --> 00:06:58,609
It's ok.

86
00:06:58,609 --> 00:07:03,387
Knowing the reason won't fix anything now.

87
00:07:05,915 --> 00:07:10,762
Densha!  If you give up now, you'll revert to your old self.

88
00:07:10,762 --> 00:07:14,106
You've always been able to get back on your feet.

89
00:07:14,106 --> 00:07:18,572
Were your feeling for Hermes so light?!!

90
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:22,978
Yeah!  Don't give up so easily!

91
00:07:22,978 --> 00:07:25,317
Why don't you keep trying to become a better man?

92
00:07:25,317 --> 00:07:26,932
Get on the offensive again!

93
00:07:26,932 --> 00:07:29,820
This isn't the Densha I remember!

94
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,084
You can still evolve!

95
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:34,300
Get up!!

96
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,532
Densha!!

97
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,996
I'm sorry.  It's no good.

98
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:46,844
I didn't know it hurt so much to be rejected.

99
00:07:46,844 --> 00:07:49,156
I'm scared to try again.

100
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,909
You idiot.

101
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:02,269
I can understand that.

102
00:08:02,269 --> 00:08:04,343
It must hurt.

We can't have you constantly changing workplaces like that.

121
00:09:58,634 --> 00:10:00,259
But see,

122
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:03,059
I don't want to work there anymore.

123
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:06,231
We still have a responsibility to our clients.

124
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:08,010
What's that face?

125
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:11,875
Sir, could you get her a new placement somewhere?

126
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,571
Eh? Eh? Eh? She's a friend of yours?

127
00:10:14,571 --> 00:10:17,939
No, we just met.

128
00:10:18,765 --> 00:10:21,006
Oh, so that's, that's, how-

129
00:10:21,006 --> 00:10:21,549
I got it.

130
00:10:21,549 --> 00:10:23,615
Oikawa-kun, your wish is my wish.

131
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,530
Hey, someone!

132
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:28,296
Someone!

133
00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:30,444
Yamada!

134
00:10:30,444 --> 00:10:33,637
Find someplace for Jinnkama-san to work.

135
00:10:35,212 --> 00:10:36,237
Yamada,

136
00:10:36,237 --> 00:10:37,565
if you don't come here in 5 seconds,

137
00:10:37,565 --> 00:10:39,543
I'm going to drop you.

138
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:44,423
Can't you forgive a lie like that?

139
00:10:44,539 --> 00:10:46,660
He was just playing while he was supposed to be at work.

140
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,558
He rejected Saori's company and went to a Otaku festival.

141
00:10:49,621 --> 00:10:51,892
No wonder I felt something was wrong.

142
00:10:51,892 --> 00:10:53,731
It's only right that it ends here.

143
00:10:53,731 --> 00:10:55,484
Stop it.

144
00:10:55,484 --> 00:10:57,701
Yamada-san isn't at fault.

145
00:10:57,701 --> 00:10:59,360
It was just a small lie...

146
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,015
He-

147
00:11:00,015 --> 00:11:02,968
There's nothing you can do.  It's not your fault.

148
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,696
Hey,

149
00:11:04,696 --> 00:11:06,657
Don't go easy on Yamada.

150
00:11:06,657 --> 00:11:07,584
Eh?

151
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:10,457
You don't think it'll work out either right?

152
00:11:10,457 --> 00:11:12,824
If that's what you really think,

153
00:11:12,824 --> 00:11:15,912
you should make it a clean break.

154
00:11:15,912 --> 00:11:19,820
If you don't, you'll both suffer more than you have to.

155
00:11:20,126 --> 00:11:23,022
So give him the cold shoulder.

156
00:11:23,385 --> 00:11:24,705
Got it?

157
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:34,870
Can't you do something about that negative energy?

158
00:11:37,536 --> 00:11:39,439
Misuzu-san!

159
00:11:44,256 --> 00:11:47,509
Hey, what're you doing?

160
00:11:47,544 --> 00:11:49,800
What a coincidence.

161
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,634
Isn't it?

162
00:11:52,496 --> 00:11:55,585
We're going to go eat, but do you guys want to come too?

163
00:11:55,585 --> 00:11:56,577
Keisuke, wait.

164
00:11:56,577 --> 00:11:57,496
Can he come too?

165
00:11:57,496 --> 00:11:59,059
Sure.

166
00:11:59,313 --> 00:12:02,630
I gotta go back and write up some reports.

167
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:07,177
You're coming too.

168
00:12:08,849 --> 00:12:10,089
Yamada-kun,

169
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:13,978
prepare the Shabu-shabu for us won't you?

170
00:12:18,617 --> 00:12:21,418
Don't keep staring at your boyfriend like that.

171
00:12:21,418 --> 00:12:22,610
I'm not.

172
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:25,304
And he's not my boyfriend.

173
00:12:26,073 --> 00:12:28,122
It's almost my sister's birthday.

174
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,570
You didn't have to say that.

175
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,106
When is it?

176
00:12:31,738 --> 00:12:34,086
August 21st.

177
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:36,379
Make sure you celebrate it with her.

178
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:38,121
I'm sure my sister wants you to.

179
00:12:38,121 --> 00:12:40,185
Keisuke.

180
00:12:40,954 --> 00:12:43,019
Oh, I forgot.

181
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:45,139
I've been called by Sakurai-san.

182
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,027
Later.

183
00:12:49,747 --> 00:12:50,035
I'm sorry.

184
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:51,683
I remembered I have to be someplace too.

185
00:12:51,683 --> 00:12:52,612
Later.

186
00:12:52,612 --> 00:12:53,603
Wait-

187
00:12:53,603 --> 00:12:54,771
Jinnkama-san!

188
00:12:54,771 --> 00:12:57,607
I told you, I have to be somewhere!

189
00:13:11,645 --> 00:13:13,354
Um..

190
00:13:14,931 --> 00:13:18,954
I'm so sorry about what happened last time.

191
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:24,269
It doesn't concern me anymore.

192
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:25,556
Eh?

193
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:33,348
I don't plan on seeing you again.

194
00:13:58,329 --> 00:14:00,044
Um.

195
00:14:01,401 --> 00:14:04,345
Which one is the dream?

196
00:14:06,018 --> 00:14:09,102
The time we were together,

197
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:15,633
or the now that I can't be with you anymore?

198
00:14:16,274 --> 00:14:18,851
Which is it?

199
00:14:28,537 --> 00:14:32,337
The days we spent together...

200
00:14:32,782 --> 00:14:35,726
weren't any dream.

201
00:14:35,218 --> 00:14:38,625
They were irreplacablely precious and real.

202
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:41,474
But now...

203
00:14:41,444 --> 00:14:46,460
They've ended.

204
00:15:12,173 --> 00:15:14,772
[Aoyama-san's birthday]

205
00:15:48,663 --> 00:15:52,193
The days we spent together...

206
00:15:53,131 --> 00:15:55,708
weren't any dream.

207
00:15:55,607 --> 00:15:59,608
They were irreplacablely precious and real.

208
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:07,748
I met Hermes-san by accident today,
and it's all clear now.

209
00:16:08,117 --> 00:16:11,933
She's was irreplaceable to me,

210
00:16:11,933 --> 00:16:15,429
and this is true even now.

211
00:16:15,464 --> 00:16:18,223
I can't let it end this way.

212
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:27,870
All right, Densha!

213
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:31,504
I was waiting for you to say that!

214
00:16:37,898 --> 00:16:40,058
Just when things started happening!!

215
00:16:40,058 --> 00:16:43,586
Then to start, we have to find out why she was so upset.

216
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:46,403
That was because you put Comike before her.

217
00:16:46,403 --> 00:16:49,971
No, it was because he turned out to be an Otaku.

218
00:16:49,971 --> 00:16:54,931
I'm sure a regular woman like Hermes will have some
kind of bias against Otaku.

219
00:16:55,363 --> 00:16:58,343
Do you think?

220
00:16:59,968 --> 00:17:02,396
It it really because I'm an Otaku?

221
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,444
Then it's easy.  Give up being an Otaku!

222
00:17:04,444 --> 00:17:06,276
Don't say that lightly.  It isn't that easy.

223
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:09,029
It's not just about changing your appearance like before.

224
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:11,739
Are you going to turn your back on your animes and figures?

225
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,532
Densha's been posessed!

226
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,604
Losing your Otaku means changing
your personality and the way you think!

227
00:17:16,604 --> 00:17:19,476
You can't just wash away your Otaku personality with soap!

228
00:17:19,476 --> 00:17:21,308
Why can't you take pride in your Otakuness?

229
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:23,284
Densha, forget this madness!!!

230
00:17:23,284 --> 00:17:24,213
He's possessed!

231
00:17:24,213 --> 00:17:26,397
I liked you when you acted like an Otaku!

232
00:17:26,397 --> 00:17:31,647
Give it up.
I only sympathized with you because you were an Otaku.

233
00:17:32,349 --> 00:17:36,730
Everyone, let's all respect Densha's choice here.

234
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:51,812
I'm sorry,

235
00:17:51,812 --> 00:17:55,758
but I want to make up with Hermes.

236
00:17:55,758 --> 00:17:59,596
This is going to upset some of you,

237
00:17:59,596 --> 00:18:04,693
but I think I'm going to try losing my Otaku.

238
00:18:04,693 --> 00:18:07,893
Just because you stop being an Otaku,
it doesn't mean Hermes will like you.

239
00:18:07,893 --> 00:18:09,342
Densha, don't worry about it.

240
00:18:09,342 --> 00:18:10,869
We'll still support you.

241
00:18:10,869 --> 00:18:11,941
I'm disappointed in you Densha.

242
00:18:11,941 --> 00:18:14,726
It's sad, but escape from our bonds and go your own way.

243
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:16,997
I'm proud of your decision.

244
00:18:16,997 --> 00:18:19,558
Do what you have to until you're satisfied.

245
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:22,574
I think it's great that you chose Hermes.

246
00:18:22,574 --> 00:18:27,452
It's too bad,
but we all want you and Hermes to get back together.

247
00:18:27,992 --> 00:18:31,556
Don't look back!  Now go young master!

248
00:18:31,834 --> 00:18:35,271
Thanks everyone!

249
00:18:35,271 --> 00:18:38,943
I'll do my best to lose my Otakuness.

250
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:57,357
What is it?  You said it's important?

251
00:18:58,389 --> 00:19:01,885
It's about going to study in America.

252
00:19:01,885 --> 00:19:04,052
That again.

253
00:19:04,052 --> 00:19:05,933
I'm serious.

254
00:19:05,933 --> 00:19:08,956
I want to study acting.

255
00:19:08,956 --> 00:19:10,094
That's a lie.

256
00:19:10,094 --> 00:19:11,271
I'm serious!

257
00:19:11,271 --> 00:19:14,005
If you were serious, you wouldn't be standing here.

258
00:19:14,005 --> 00:19:16,461
Enough about that.  This is your schedule for tomorrow.

259
00:19:16,461 --> 00:19:18,574
First thing we have...

260
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,683
Karin, Karin-chan?

261
00:19:22,142 --> 00:19:23,821
Too bad Densha.

262
00:19:23,821 --> 00:19:25,966
While you're busy trying to lose your Otaku,

263
00:19:25,966 --> 00:19:28,726
Saori's going to fall in love with me.

264
00:19:28,726 --> 00:19:33,683
And that'll grow into true love.

265
00:19:37,903 --> 00:19:39,707
How about something light?

266
00:19:39,999 --> 00:19:41,744
Herme-  Saori!

267
00:19:45,382 --> 00:19:46,561
What is it, Kazuya-san?

268
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:50,306
I just happened to be passing thru,
so I thought you might want to get something to eat.

269
00:19:50,306 --> 00:19:51,987
The two of us.

270
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:53,074
But-

271
00:19:53,074 --> 00:19:54,795
You don't have to worry about us.

272
00:19:54,795 --> 00:19:55,674
Right.

273
00:19:55,674 --> 00:19:57,227
You two have fun.

274
00:19:57,451 --> 00:19:58,434
Sorry.

275
00:19:58,434 --> 00:20:00,002
Don't be.

276
00:20:00,002 --> 00:20:02,140
Let's go.

277
00:20:05,674 --> 00:20:07,140
They seem to be getting along.

278
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,042
I hope it goes well between those two.

279
00:20:19,807 --> 00:20:21,679
Deal with the room first.

280
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,942
Get rid of all your figures.

281
00:20:26,287 --> 00:20:28,639
I can't.

282
00:20:28,639 --> 00:20:32,051
It looks like you're going to have to put your personal feelings aside.

283
00:20:41,592 --> 00:20:44,829
Sell all your games for the money.

284
00:20:49,552 --> 00:20:51,605
\2300

285
00:20:53,247 --> 00:20:55,243
\1500

286
00:20:56,617 --> 00:20:59,291
\320

287
00:20:59,326 --> 00:21:01,558
The more they mean, the less they're worth.

288
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:03,480
We're having a promotional deal.

289
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,252
Cheer up, take one.

290
00:21:09,847 --> 00:21:11,991
Top Prize.

291
00:21:11,991 --> 00:21:13,687
Top Prize?

292
00:21:13,687 --> 00:21:16,431
The latest game console and 10 games.

293
00:21:16,431 --> 00:21:19,369
That's more than I started with.

294
00:21:22,601 --> 00:21:25,893
You have to be careful where you throw them out.

295
00:21:30,176 --> 00:21:33,231
Goodbye, Zaku.

296
00:21:51,822 --> 00:21:56,512
To everyone who gave up their lives in Operation Odessa,

297
00:21:56,547 --> 00:21:58,310
we give our profound thanks.

298
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,447
All hands,

299
00:21:59,447 --> 00:22:01,863
Atten-hut.

300
00:22:21,103 --> 00:22:22,188
Matilda-san.

301
00:22:23,515 --> 00:22:24,358
Matilda-san.

302
00:22:26,365 --> 00:22:27,343
Matilda-san.

303
00:22:29,267 --> 00:22:31,516
Matilda-san!

304
00:22:39,231 --> 00:22:41,873
Are you also a fan?

305
00:22:41,905 --> 00:22:43,655
Maybe not?

306
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:44,824
Ok, then.

307
00:22:44,824 --> 00:22:46,704
In a hurry, gotta go. 

308
00:22:46,704 --> 00:22:50,153
I'm sorry.  Sorry to the 100th power.

309
00:22:51,548 --> 00:22:53,888
Am, Amuro?

310
00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:02,241
Why?

311
00:23:02,241 --> 00:23:04,305
The guy who found the boxes

312
00:23:04,305 --> 00:23:06,209
saw these labels and brought them here.

313
00:23:07,229 --> 00:23:08,076
How about these?

314
00:23:08,076 --> 00:23:09,935
He brought them too.

315
00:23:14,421 --> 00:23:18,128
My collection increased again...

316
00:23:21,828 --> 00:23:24,271
Matilda-san.

317
00:23:28,421 --> 00:23:32,037
For Matsunaga-san           For Kawamoto-san
You're really going to quit being an Otaku?

318
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:33,477
Yes.

319
00:23:33,477 --> 00:23:36,309
You have no regrets?

320
00:23:36,309 --> 00:23:37,383
No.

321
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:41,180
Yamada-shi, I think it best if you re-consider.

322
00:23:41,326 --> 00:23:42,733
I got it.

323
00:23:42,733 --> 00:23:44,965
Let's begin.

324
00:23:46,382 --> 00:23:48,383
Yamada Tsuyoshi.

325
00:23:48,383 --> 00:23:52,229
You have overcome countless hurdles

326
00:23:52,229 --> 00:23:54,942
and now are graduating from being a true Otaku.

327
00:23:54,942 --> 00:23:57,812
I hereby declare you non-Otaku.

328
00:24:00,952 --> 00:24:03,258
I'm to give these to you.

329
00:24:04,823 --> 00:24:08,144
I might have been infected!

330
00:24:08,144 --> 00:24:09,487
Yamada Tsuyoshi-kun

331
00:24:09,487 --> 00:24:12,415
Banzai!

332
00:24:12,415 --> 00:24:14,183
Thank you.

333
00:24:22,593 --> 00:24:23,631
What is it?

334
00:24:23,631 --> 00:24:26,791
It seems we're always together nowadays.

335
00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:27,832
Do you mind?

336
00:24:27,832 --> 00:24:29,392
No.

337
00:24:30,393 --> 00:24:32,144
It's your birthday next Sunday right?

338
00:24:32,144 --> 00:24:33,431
Uh huh.

339
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:35,144
Do you have plans?

340
00:24:35,144 --> 00:24:37,385
I'm going to celebrate with Kaho and Yuuko.

341
00:24:37,912 --> 00:24:38,536
Then do it at my place.

342
00:24:38,536 --> 00:24:41,085
We'll make it grand.

343
00:24:42,177 --> 00:24:44,543
I'll ask them then.

344
00:24:54,684 --> 00:24:56,996
Noritake
Yoshino (5 pc Dessert Plate Set)
incl. taxes    \26,250

345
00:24:57,031 --> 00:24:59,211
That's steep!

346
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,063
Take care guys.

347
00:25:18,771 --> 00:25:20,862
All right.

348
00:25:30,676 --> 00:25:33,955
I've successfully graduated from being an Otaku.

349
00:25:33,955 --> 00:25:38,151
I've also managed to get hold of a suitable
present for Hermes' birthday tomorrow.

350
00:25:38,615 --> 00:25:42,866
Can anyone give me some serious
suggestions for what I should say?

351
00:25:42,901 --> 00:25:44,950
You're going to have to call her of course.

352
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,999
Even if she doesn't answer, you can leave her voice mail.

353
00:25:46,999 --> 00:25:51,222
Since it's her birthday tomorrow, why not call her at midnight?

354
00:25:52,672 --> 00:25:54,880
Isn't it rude calling her so late?

355
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,687
It's different if it's her birthday.

356
00:25:56,687 --> 00:25:59,031
She won't mind if it's a congratulatory call.

357
00:25:59,031 --> 00:26:03,047
I just remembered an old boyfriend
who used to call me on my birthday.

358
00:26:03,047 --> 00:26:05,807
"I want to meet you on your birthday",
it makes it easier to ask her doesn't it?

359
00:26:05,807 --> 00:26:07,223
That's true.

360
00:26:07,223 --> 00:26:09,136
She still might not say yes.

361
00:26:09,136 --> 00:26:12,592
She's probably got plans, so tell her you only need a bit of her time.

362
00:26:12,592 --> 00:26:15,168
Show her a part of you you've never shown.

363
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,560
Your masculine side.

364
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,288
Be firm.

365
00:26:17,288 --> 00:26:17,905
Be aggressive.

366
00:26:17,905 --> 00:26:20,496
Just don't back down.

367
00:26:21,249 --> 00:26:23,457
I don't have confidence.

368
00:26:25,872 --> 00:26:26,945
It can be an act.

369
00:26:26,945 --> 00:26:29,769
It's enough that she thinks you might have changed.

370
00:26:29,769 --> 00:26:33,064
You have to do this to break free from your Otaku image.

371
00:26:33,064 --> 00:26:37,838
You just have tell her how you feel without anything holding back.

372
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:41,579
I think I can do that.

373
00:26:41,579 --> 00:26:45,989
I'll think about how I'll tell her on my own.

374
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:52,782
"I'll think about it on my own", huh.

375
00:26:52,782 --> 00:26:54,466
You've grown.

376
00:26:54,466 --> 00:26:56,958
Wait for me Densha,

377
00:26:56,958 --> 00:27:00,283
That guy needs me.

378
00:27:29,508 --> 00:27:31,514
Yamada Tsuyoshi

379
00:27:43,187 --> 00:27:43,850
Yes?

380
00:27:43,885 --> 00:27:45,110
Uh,

381
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,377
This is Yamada calling.

382
00:27:53,317 --> 00:27:57,153
Congratulations on your birthday.

383
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:05,959
What is this?

384
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:07,662
You see,

385
00:28:07,662 --> 00:28:11,083
I wanted to hand something to you today.

386
00:28:12,871 --> 00:28:14,823
I think I told you already.

387
00:28:14,823 --> 00:28:16,416
I won't see-

388
00:28:16,416 --> 00:28:18,576
I don't want to think-

389
00:28:18,576 --> 00:28:19,167
Yes?

390
00:28:19,167 --> 00:28:23,703
I don't want to think you were just a dream.

391
00:28:26,152 --> 00:28:27,937
At 7 o'clock today,

392
00:28:27,937 --> 00:28:31,484
I'll be waiting where we first met.

393
00:28:32,649 --> 00:28:33,976
I won't go.

394
00:28:33,976 --> 00:28:36,279
I'll be waiting anyway.

395
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:39,033
Goodbye.

396
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,617
Was that too aggressive?

397
00:29:11,692 --> 00:29:13,609
This is for Saori.

398
00:29:13,684 --> 00:29:18,330
No, I'm offering this to Hermes.

399
00:29:21,405 --> 00:29:24,366
I have a present for you.

400
00:29:24,785 --> 00:29:26,949
What is it?

401
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,025
Here,

402
00:29:34,761 --> 00:29:38,147
this will be our first ritual together.

403
00:29:41,105 --> 00:29:42,649
This way.

404
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,277
That's so pretty!

405
00:30:00,985 --> 00:30:02,475
Hermes.

406
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:04,592
I want you to forgive me

407
00:30:04,592 --> 00:30:09,824
for not realizing we were destined for each other.

408
00:30:12,416 --> 00:30:13,504
Hermes.

409
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,846
Densha,

410
00:30:23,672 --> 00:30:27,254
Hermes is mine now.

411
00:30:29,772 --> 00:30:32,253
Application for Divorce



Aoyama Kengo

412
00:30:33,253 --> 00:30:33,990
What is that?

413
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,364
Hm?

414
00:30:38,301 --> 00:30:40,781
I'm practicing some magic.

415
00:30:40,781 --> 00:30:42,341
It's your birthday today isn't it?

416
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:45,029
I thought I would show you something.

417
00:30:45,029 --> 00:30:46,535
Really?

418
00:30:47,143 --> 00:30:49,355
I was joking.

419
00:30:50,046 --> 00:30:51,750
So where are you off to?

420
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,015
A date maybe?

421
00:30:53,015 --> 00:30:54,150
No.

422
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:58,062
Kayo and some friends are throwing me a party.

423
00:30:58,414 --> 00:31:00,408
Really?

424
00:31:01,247 --> 00:31:04,318
You didn't break up did you?

425
00:31:04,318 --> 00:31:06,127
It's none of your business.

426
00:31:06,127 --> 00:31:08,094
So that's why.

427
00:31:08,094 --> 00:31:12,263
You don't glitter the way you used to.

428
00:31:12,263 --> 00:31:13,422
I haven't changed a bit.

429
00:31:13,422 --> 00:31:15,611
See you later.

430
00:31:17,783 --> 00:31:19,439
Glitter huh?

431
00:31:46,002 --> 00:31:49,363
Hermes-san's birthday's finally here.

432
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:56,256
She probably won't come.

433
00:31:57,707 --> 00:32:00,476
But I think I'll wait.

434
00:32:01,203 --> 00:32:04,684
Not just so I can say I did.

435
00:32:09,851 --> 00:32:15,357
Up until now I thought time passed at the same rate.

436
00:32:17,498 --> 00:32:20,734
But it doesn't.

437
00:32:25,924 --> 00:32:31,194
When I'm waiting for her, time seems to stretch on for eternity.

438
00:32:32,396 --> 00:32:36,828
When I'm with her, it passes in an instant.

439
00:32:37,532 --> 00:32:44,268
I don't want to have any regrets about
this relationship that taught me so much.

440
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:54,413
And you were ones who reminded me of this.

441
00:32:57,063 --> 00:33:00,120
I'm always the one relying on you,

442
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:02,484
but I have nothing to give you in return.

443
00:33:02,484 --> 00:33:05,055
I'm sorry.

444
00:33:17,415 --> 00:33:20,914
I'm going to make up for that by waiting here.

445
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:22,484
Probably,

446
00:33:22,484 --> 00:33:24,712
as time passes...

447
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:26,231
I'll become so sad

448
00:33:26,231 --> 00:33:27,871
it'll hurt.

449
00:33:27,871 --> 00:33:29,335
And get scared,

450
00:33:29,335 --> 00:33:31,767
and want to leave.

451
00:33:31,767 --> 00:33:35,962
But I'll stay and wait for her.

452
00:33:36,239 --> 00:33:39,187
Because you guys are here for me.

453
00:33:39,937 --> 00:33:42,074
I know.

454
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,680
You can do it.

455
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,837
We're there for you.

456
00:33:46,872 --> 00:33:50,066
We'll be waiting here too.

457
00:33:50,101 --> 00:33:51,977
The ticket's only one way.

458
00:33:51,977 --> 00:33:54,114
Fight!  Densha.

459
00:33:54,169 --> 00:33:56,144
Densha-kun, you can do it.

460
00:33:56,144 --> 00:33:57,177
Persevere!

461
00:33:57,177 --> 00:33:58,336
Give it everything!

462
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:00,632
We'll keep cheering you on.

463
00:34:00,632 --> 00:34:01,809
Have confidence.

464
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:03,177
We'll be watching over you.

465
00:34:03,177 --> 00:34:04,456
We're all there for you.

466
00:34:04,456 --> 00:34:05,529
Densha, keep at it.

467
00:34:05,529 --> 00:34:06,616
It's all heart.

468
00:34:06,616 --> 00:34:08,201
Densha-san, you can do it.

469
00:34:08,201 --> 00:34:11,233
Hermes, go to him.

470
00:34:11,233 --> 00:34:14,059
As long as you wait, she'll come.

471
00:34:21,214 --> 00:34:23,279
Who does she think she is?

472
00:34:23,279 --> 00:34:25,206
Going off to study?

473
00:34:26,845 --> 00:34:28,973
Bring her back.

474
00:34:28,973 --> 00:34:30,946
Sir,

475
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:33,910
Please let her go.

476
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:36,422
You knew about this?

477
00:34:36,422 --> 00:34:38,223
Please.

478
00:34:38,223 --> 00:34:41,348
She's serious.

479
00:34:42,751 --> 00:34:45,186
[Hirayama Manager
I'm serious about this!!
-Karin]

You can do it, Karin.

[Happy Birthday]
[Hermes   Densha Otoko]

483
00:35:34,768 --> 00:35:36,054
Saori,

484
00:35:36,054 --> 00:35:38,111
where's Sakurai-san?

485
00:35:38,111 --> 00:35:40,224
It doesn't look like he's here yet.

486
00:35:40,224 --> 00:35:42,563
Sakurai-san...

487
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,060
Shoot!

488
00:35:45,855 --> 00:35:48,366
Everyone sure is late.

489
00:35:49,251 --> 00:35:52,224
Maybe I got the time wrong.

490
00:35:58,088 --> 00:35:59,664
Yes, Healthy Drink-

491
00:35:59,664 --> 00:36:01,353
Hey, Keisuke!

492
00:36:01,353 --> 00:36:03,064
What are you doing?

493
00:36:03,064 --> 00:36:05,808
Today's party-

494
00:36:05,808 --> 00:36:08,913
Oh, they changed the venue.

495
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,345
They changed the venue?

496
00:36:12,345 --> 00:36:14,034
Uh huh.

497
00:36:14,034 --> 00:36:15,353
Uh huh.

498
00:36:15,353 --> 00:36:17,403
Got it.

499
00:36:17,417 --> 00:36:20,002
Tell me earlier!

500
00:36:20,002 --> 00:36:22,990
I can't prepare this somewhere else!

I'll be right there Hermes.

502
00:36:45,642 --> 00:36:48,411
Wait for me.

503
00:37:07,697 --> 00:37:10,499
Are you waiting for someone?

504
00:37:10,499 --> 00:37:13,051
You look like you're worried about the time.

505
00:37:13,051 --> 00:37:15,643
No, not really.

506
00:37:16,413 --> 00:37:19,985
Ok, then I won't worry.

507
00:37:20,124 --> 00:37:23,304
There aren't any good men today.

508
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:36,200
Do you want to go somewhere to drink after this?

509
00:37:39,073 --> 00:37:41,335
Actually, I can't.

510
00:37:44,744 --> 00:37:46,948
You have something else?

511
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,865
Misuzu-san!

512
00:37:51,479 --> 00:37:53,607
Who is she?

513
00:37:53,607 --> 00:37:55,994
Just someone I know.

514
00:37:57,488 --> 00:37:58,944
It suddenly started raining.

515
00:37:58,944 --> 00:37:59,960
Really?

516
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,561
Are you ok?

517
00:38:22,278 --> 00:38:24,024
Good evening.

518
00:38:25,364 --> 00:38:26,686
Misuzu-san.

519
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:29,282
Happy Birthday.

520
00:38:29,282 --> 00:38:31,579
Thank you.

521
00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:32,892
Do you mind?

522
00:38:32,892 --> 00:38:39,219
No.

523
00:38:39,219 --> 00:38:41,366
He isn't here?

524
00:38:43,483 --> 00:38:45,146
Yamada Tsuyoshi.

525
00:38:49,923 --> 00:38:52,966
So I guess he's waiting somewhere else.

526
00:38:54,019 --> 00:38:55,915
You know,

527
00:38:55,915 --> 00:38:58,804
he's so awkward, and such a dunce.

528
00:38:58,804 --> 00:39:01,747
I get noxious just being near him.

529
00:39:03,196 --> 00:39:05,197
Even then,

530
00:39:05,197 --> 00:39:08,624
I somehow can't leave him alone.

531
00:39:10,124 --> 00:39:11,501
Don't get me wrong,

532
00:39:11,501 --> 00:39:15,115
it's not like there's anything going on with us.

533
00:39:20,869 --> 00:39:22,317
Hey,

534
00:39:22,317 --> 00:39:25,093
Do you think time passes constantly?

535
00:39:25,093 --> 00:39:26,385
Hm?

536
00:39:27,822 --> 00:39:31,341
That guy told me,

537
00:39:31,341 --> 00:39:34,541
When you're waiting for someone you like,

538
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:38,653
time seems to stretch on for eternity.

539
00:39:38,653 --> 00:39:40,647
And when you're with them,

540
00:39:40,647 --> 00:39:44,686
it passes in an instant.

541
00:39:44,686 --> 00:39:47,271
Right now,

542
00:39:47,271 --> 00:39:53,571
he's probably waiting for what feels like eternity.

543
00:39:55,383 --> 00:39:58,756
Was waiting anyway.

544
00:39:59,982 --> 00:40:07,454
In this rain I guess even he would have left by now...

545
00:40:07,454 --> 00:40:08,820
Saori!

546
00:40:09,999 --> 00:40:10,983
Sakurai-san.

547
00:40:12,592 --> 00:40:13,641
Keisuke.

548
00:40:14,048 --> 00:40:14,805
Herme-

549
00:40:15,135 --> 00:40:16,642
Where's Saori?

550
00:40:16,927 --> 00:40:18,410
There.

551
00:40:21,664 --> 00:40:22,432
Saori.

552
00:40:22,432 --> 00:40:23,575
Kazuya-san.

553
00:40:23,576 --> 00:40:24,943
I want you to come with me.

554
00:40:24,943 --> 00:40:27,647
I've got something I want to show you.

555
00:40:28,897 --> 00:40:30,793
I was so close.

556
00:40:30,793 --> 00:40:32,505
Who is that guy?

557
00:40:47,393 --> 00:40:50,734
Sorry for dragging you out so suddenly.

558
00:40:50,808 --> 00:40:52,458
I had to show you something.

559
00:40:52,458 --> 00:40:54,725
We're almost there.

560
00:40:55,594 --> 00:40:57,345
You'll definitely be surprised.

561
00:40:57,345 --> 00:41:00,777
And I think you'll be happy.

562
00:41:00,777 --> 00:41:02,097
Stop the car.

563
00:41:02,097 --> 00:41:03,954
Hm?

564
00:41:03,954 --> 00:41:05,871
Stop the car!

565
00:41:08,889 --> 00:41:11,354
What is it?

566
00:41:11,354 --> 00:41:15,094
You wanted to bring me here?

567
00:41:16,234 --> 00:41:17,882
No, no.

568
00:41:17,882 --> 00:41:20,333
To my store.

569
00:41:23,427 --> 00:41:26,938
You brought me here to meet Yamada-san?

570
00:41:26,938 --> 00:41:29,134
Uh huh.

571
00:41:29,995 --> 00:41:32,298
Well...

572
00:41:32,298 --> 00:41:33,780
Thank you.

573
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,795
It's nothing.

574
00:41:41,349 --> 00:41:42,639
Huh? Wait-

575
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:44,509
What just happened?

576
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,902
Aoyama-san.

577
00:41:58,999 --> 00:42:01,551
What are you doing?

578
00:42:01,982 --> 00:42:06,215
I was going to go buy an umbrella,

579
00:42:09,512 --> 00:42:12,232
but then...

580
00:42:12,232 --> 00:42:17,977
I was afraid we'd miss each other.

581
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,351
What were you thinking of?

582
00:42:23,351 --> 00:42:27,921
Your face when you smile.

583
00:42:29,026 --> 00:42:32,274
That's what I was imagining.

584
00:42:37,399 --> 00:42:40,513
 I, I've...

585
00:42:42,952 --> 00:42:49,938
stopped being an Otaku.

586
00:42:54,328 --> 00:42:58,599
I wanted to be...

587
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:02,382
worthy of you.

588
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,144
You're wrong.

589
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:11,480
That's not why.

590
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,636
That's not why I was angry.

591
00:43:19,592 --> 00:43:23,119
It's my fault.

592
00:43:24,147 --> 00:43:26,886
Because I couldn't forgive...

593
00:43:28,857 --> 00:43:33,769
such a small lie.

594
00:43:37,577 --> 00:43:40,278
I'm sorry.

595
00:43:41,945 --> 00:43:46,443
If we're together for any longer,

596
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:50,756
I'll just hurt you more.

597
00:43:51,994 --> 00:43:53,954
So...

598
00:43:58,250 --> 00:43:59,773
Yamada-san?

599
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:09,398
Happy...

600
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:12,555
Birth...

601
00:44:13,768 --> 00:44:15,186
day.

602
00:44:17,795 --> 00:44:19,221
Yamada-san!

603
00:44:22,531 --> 00:44:25,051
I'll...

604
00:44:25,051 --> 00:44:27,355
become...

605
00:44:27,355 --> 00:44:31,289
a better man.

606
00:44:33,947 --> 00:44:36,299
much...

607
00:44:38,979 --> 00:44:40,180
Yamada-san!

608
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,588
Are you ok?

609
00:44:41,588 --> 00:44:43,647
Yamada-san!

610
00:46:17,458 --> 00:46:19,529
Next Week

611
00:46:47,363 --> 00:46:49,606
This peice of fiction was based on a true story.
