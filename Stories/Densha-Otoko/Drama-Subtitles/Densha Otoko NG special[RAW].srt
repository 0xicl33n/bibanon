Do you two guys talk a lot? During filming?

15
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:25,997
We do a lot, right?

16
00:00:25,997 --> 00:00:27,657
Yes, we are close to each other

17
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:33,629
Ito Misaki-san, have you ever thought of Ito-kun as a possible boyfriend?

18
00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:33,913
Different from before

19
00:00:33,913 --> 00:00:35,795
Not yet...

20
00:00:35,795 --> 00:00:38,454
After the drama finishes...

21
00:00:44,852 --> 00:00:47,119
Do you know Ito (Misaki)-san's mail address, Ito-kun?

22
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,631
That is...

23
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,322
Secret

24
00:00:50,322 --> 00:00:51,946

Numbers!

33
00:01:21,294 --> 00:01:24,674
Maybe an incredible number might appear?!

34
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:26,596
Here it comes...

35
00:01:26,596 --> 00:01:30,251

200 people

37
00:01:36,521 --> 00:01:38,945
The animation at the opening of the drama

38
00:01:38,945 --> 00:01:43,971
It was created specifically for this drama

39
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,573
And this ending theme by Sambo Master

40
00:01:51,573 --> 00:01:52,731
Actually, this scene...

41
00:01:52,731 --> 00:01:54,929
Was filmed after the trains stopped

42
00:01:54,929 --> 00:01:56,757
At Akihabara Station Overnight!

43
00:01:56,757 --> 00:01:59,398
It was just for 1 min 30 secs... and extras?

44
00:01:59,398 --> 00:02:01,436
Surprisingly, 200 people!

45
00:02:01,436 --> 00:02:05,301
This was the first time ever borrowing Akihabara Station for filming!

46
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:08,996
48 hours

47
00:02:09,466 --> 00:02:13,879
These people on the Internet, who are so vital to "Densha Otoko"

48
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:16,032
There are a lot of different faces

49
00:02:16,032 --> 00:02:19,505
There were over 35 people who made appearances

50
00:02:19,505 --> 00:02:20,381
[From the 5th episode]
How much?!!

51
00:02:20,381 --> 00:02:21,322
[From the 5th episode]
What a chance, but...

52
00:02:21,322 --> 00:02:23,926
[From the 5th episode]
I also want to walk Hermes-san home!

53
00:02:23,926 --> 00:02:26,923
But walking Hermes-san... you have grown up!

54
00:02:26,923 --> 00:02:27,756
This Internet scene...

55
00:02:27,756 --> 00:02:31,165
For one episode, it took 48 hours of filming!

56
00:02:31,165 --> 00:02:33,828
Why does it take so long?

57
00:02:33,828 --> 00:02:36,557
YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

58
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:38,661
YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

59
00:02:38,661 --> 00:02:39,131
Huh?

60
00:02:39,131 --> 00:02:41,582
This is so different from the drama!

61
00:02:41,582 --> 00:02:42,702
Actually this internet scene...

62
00:02:42,702 --> 00:02:44,830
Everyone recorded their voices first

63
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,574
And then based on the voices recorded

64
00:02:46,574 --> 00:02:49,856
They filmed their acting

65
00:02:49,856 --> 00:02:51,810
To add, their rooms were

66
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,927
All side by side like this

67
00:02:54,927 --> 00:02:59,277
From this 48 hours of fliming, only 7 minutes were aired in this episode

68
00:02:59,277 --> 00:03:00,746
Good job!

3000

70
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:06,221
The things that attracted our attention in this drama

71
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:08,830
Were things that filled Densha Otoko's or the Internet people's rooms

72
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,036
The Otaku Stuff!

73
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:12,819
To add, this figure was...

74
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:15,537
4000 dollars (400,000 yen)!!!

75
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:17,418
In Densha Otoko's room

76
00:03:17,418 --> 00:03:21,473
There are 132 pieces!!!

77
00:03:21,473 --> 00:03:23,150
The special objects in this drama...

78
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,360
Number of those are!!

79
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,159
3000!!!

80
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,639
A... Amazing!!!

81

1000 Hours

82
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:35,034
Now, let's see the two people's work until now!

83
00:03:35,034 --> 00:03:35,639
This time,

84
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:39,891
Densha Otoko, who did his best for Hermes, Ito Misaki-san

85
00:03:39,891 --> 00:03:41,318
Ito Atsushi-kun

86
00:03:41,318 --> 00:03:45,077
Forgive me please

87
00:03:45,077 --> 00:03:47,875
[From the 4th episode]
First, this scene

88
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:52,674
It is the scene where he practices surfing for Hermes

89
00:03:52,674 --> 00:03:54,096
Looks so cold~

90
00:03:55,505 --> 00:03:57,401
Falling down many times...

91
00:03:58,814 --> 00:04:01,075
Even if it is just filming, it looks so hard

92
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:05,535
The time spent to film this scene was 5 hours!

93
00:04:06,233 --> 00:04:06,439
[From the 7th episode]

94
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:08,663
[From the 7th episode]
Why?

95
00:04:08,663 --> 00:04:09,834
And this one

96
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:16,370
Densha Otoko, waiting for Hermes to give her the present in the rain

97
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,473
Happy Birthday

98
00:04:17,473 --> 00:04:22,582
In this touching scene, both had to film for 6 hours in the rain

99
00:04:22,582 --> 00:04:24,605
They are serious, aren't they?

100
00:04:25,153 --> 00:04:26,354
And there are...

101
00:04:26,354 --> 00:04:27,216
Only two episodes left!

102
00:04:27,216 --> 00:04:30,223
If we add up all the filming time between the two

103
00:04:30,223 --> 00:04:32,725
It amounts up to more than 1000 hours!

104
00:04:32,725 --> 00:04:35,074
They are both really working hard!

105
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:39,052
And the scene where Densha Otoko really gave his all?

106
00:04:39,052 --> 00:04:40,572
Here it is!!!!!

107

112
00:04:59,002 --> 00:04:59,962
Oh! Wait, Hermes just fell down?

113
00:04:59,962 --> 00:05:00,419
Did you see that?

114

Did you just see that?

115
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,343
She just fell down!

00:07:07,482 --> 00:07:09,829
It is 4000 dollars...

167
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:11,450
Oh crap...

168
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,849
Atsushi-kun... You did it...

169
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:17,172
Until now was Densha Otoko's memorable scenes!

170
00:07:20,814 --> 00:07:23,600
Oh, the figure... 4000 dollars... Were you all right?

171
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,101
No, really,

172
00:07:24,101 --> 00:07:29,242
At that moment, everyone became so quiet

173
00:07:29,242 --> 00:07:29,867
Um...

174
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:31,274
It was broken...

175
00:07:31,274 --> 00:07:34,897
So what we have now is No.2

176
00:07:35,876 --> 00:07:38,651
The scene with rain... It took 6 hours...

177
00:07:38,651 --> 00:07:41,140
We filmed until 6am

178
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,392
We filmed right until the sunrise

179
00:07:44,392 --> 00:07:45,724
We kept it pouring

180
00:07:45,724 --> 00:07:48,618
You guys filmed together for 1000 hours now?

181
00:07:48,618 --> 00:07:51,001
They were together for 1000 hours!

182
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,466
- Are you jealous?

183
00:07:52,466 --> 00:07:53,792
- So jealous!
- Are you jealous?

184
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:59,694
When do you wanna stop being a love-love grandpa?!

185
00:07:59,694 --> 00:08:00,411
But it was awesome, right?

186
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:01,624
It was awesome

187
00:08:01,624 --> 00:08:02,648
Awesome

188
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,674
There are some elements to it where you just can't act, right?

189
00:08:08,025 --> 00:08:12,092
During acting, I learned who Misuzu was...

190
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:13,854
You learned about another self inside you?

191
00:08:13,854 --> 00:08:14,334
Right

192
00:08:14,334 --> 00:08:16,416
Chiba-san, how is she as a fellow actress?

193
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:17,838
Wow, amazing!

194
00:08:17,838 --> 00:08:19,177
To identify so much with the character

195
00:08:19,177 --> 00:08:23,042
I was wondering what it was like to have my image changed

196
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:24,273
Now, you guys are filming the last episode, right?

197
00:08:24,273 --> 00:08:26,460
Are you guys even getting enough sleep?

198
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,570
No, it is quite HARD

199
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,415
Now, it is HARD

200
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,263
For the last episode

201
00:08:30,263 --> 00:08:31,103
We are giving it all

202
00:08:31,103 --> 00:08:33,584
The last episode is 90 minutes...

203
00:08:34,084 --> 00:08:36,007
So is any part different from the original story?

204
00:08:36,007 --> 00:08:37,369
Until you see it...

205
00:08:37,369 --> 00:08:38,793
Please look forward to it!

206
00:08:38,793 --> 00:08:39,924
Tell us~
