00:00:02,523 --> 00:00:03,821
I have something...

2
00:00:05,185 --> 00:00:06,681
Important to say...

3
00:00:09,214 --> 00:00:11,172
When I was with Misuzu...

4
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:14,444
Everything was shining..

5
00:00:14,444 --> 00:00:16,326
This confession is...

6
00:00:16,326 --> 00:00:20,387
From Misuzu I have received...

7
00:00:20,943 --> 00:00:21,895
So many precious things...

8
00:00:26,681 --> 00:00:27,571
Hello?

9
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:28,437
Oh, dad?

10
00:00:28,437 --> 00:00:29,592
What's happening?

11
00:00:29,592 --> 00:00:31,227
Oh, the company is bankrupt?

12
00:00:31,227 --> 00:00:32,071
WHAT? What are you saying?

13
00:00:32,071 --> 00:00:34,138
You are closing my shop too? No way!

Hello? Dad?

16
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:40,875
Dad is...

17
00:00:41,286 --> 00:00:42,731
Bankrupt...

18
00:00:42,731 --> 00:00:44,847
He is bankrupt...

19
00:00:50,058 --> 00:00:51,407

20
00:00:51,407 --> 00:00:52,648

27
00:01:13,035 --> 00:01:15,526
Weren't we destined for each other?

28
00:01:15,526 --> 00:01:18,103
Shut up about destiny and go earn some money

29
00:01:20,452 --> 00:01:22,254
I will take this as a good-bye present

30
00:01:22,254 --> 00:01:23,932

00:01:34,272 --> 00:01:40,530
Ahhhhhhh!!!!

35
00:01:56,428 --> 00:01:58,528

36
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,701
Okay

37
00:02:03,261 --> 00:02:06,382
Separately, right?

38
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:08,907
Right

39

No

43

44
00:02:44,649 --> 00:02:46,183
Can we hold... hands?

45
00:02:46,809 --> 00:02:47,853
Of... Of course!

46
00:02:56,527 --> 00:03:01,553
Did the forum exist before you started writing there?

47
00:03:02,211 --> 00:03:03,010
Yes

48
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,580
Definitely, even before I started writing...

49
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,969
The issue that was discussed was...

50
00:03:12,557 --> 00:03:14,992
[3 months before]

51
00:03:17,059 --> 00:03:19,066
Today, I met the online girlfriend

52
00:03:20,887 --> 00:03:22,765
I have been reporting to you about

53
00:03:24,284 --> 00:03:26,243

00:03:35,697 --> 00:03:38,260
It is the return of Guitar Otoko

59
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,862
Everyone, to the shelter!

60
00:03:39,862 --> 00:03:42,521
Here comes Guitar Otoko's bombing!

61
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:44,467
But why Guitar Otoko?

62
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:47,432
The girl he met through an online dating service likes musicians

63
00:03:47,432 --> 00:03:50,196
So he practiced guitar through online lessons

64
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:52,684
They actually met? Amazing!

65
00:03:52,684 --> 00:03:54,392
So many people are waiting to scam people on the online services

66
00:03:54,392 --> 00:03:56,550
The chance of actually meeting is 1 out of 10

67
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,181
Especially, if she is pretty, the chance is like 1000 to 1

68
00:03:59,181 --> 00:04:01,394
Good thing I skipped my work today!

69
00:04:01,394 --> 00:04:03,827
Did you show her your guitar skills?

70
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,997
My heart is beating loudly!

71
00:04:05,997 --> 00:04:07,436
Please explain in detail!

72
00:04:08,778 --> 00:04:11,094
We decided to drink tea before I got to show her my guitar

73
00:04:11,094 --> 00:04:14,217
But I was forced to buy an old guitar for 3 million yen
(*3 million yen = 30,000 dollars)

74
00:04:15,141 --> 00:04:16,788
Is this 3 million?

75
00:04:16,788 --> 00:04:18,759
I asked my friend who knows a lot about guitars

76
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,940
And he said he will sell this especially for you

77
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,914
This is a really awesome guitar!

78
00:04:21,914 --> 00:04:27,445
The world-renowned band Biga Pants used this guitar in their concert, "Tomorrow"

79
00:04:33,554 --> 00:04:35,209
Bi... Biga Pants?

80
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:37,835
I never heard of Biga Pants...

81
00:04:37,835 --> 00:04:39,716
No I think it is just us who don't know

82
00:04:39,716 --> 00:04:41,736
I will tell you as a music otaku

83
00:04:41,736 --> 00:04:44,065
Such a band does not exist!

84
00:04:44,065 --> 00:04:46,521
Biga Pants... I never heard of them...

85
00:04:46,521 --> 00:04:47,483
How can you say that...

86
00:04:47,483 --> 00:04:50,560
You said you were interested in guitars in the mail you sent

87
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,223
That is because Miyoko-san said you like them...

88
00:04:55,176 --> 00:04:57,317
Then will you buy it?

89
00:04:57,317 --> 00:04:59,878
But there are two strings missing...

That makes it even more unique

92
00:05:04,168 --> 00:05:07,489
I thought you were a guitar maniac

93
00:05:07,489 --> 00:05:10,004
So I begged my friend to sell this...

94
00:05:11,917 --> 00:05:12,487
Okay

95
00:05:12,487 --> 00:05:14,044

Who got a fortune off of your crappy guitar?

108
00:05:50,324 --> 00:05:55,176
This guitar... Wasn't this used by Biga Pants?

109
00:05:55,176 --> 00:05:57,112
What is Biga Pants?

110
00:05:57,112 --> 00:05:58,570
If you are talking about money, I won't return it

111
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:01,635
Even on the contract, it says no refund

112
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,429
Did you lie to me...

113
00:06:09,872 --> 00:06:14,089
Was it a lie when you said you liked me...?

114
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:16,042
Of course it was a lie

00:06:43,767 --> 00:06:45,653
So this was a scam to rip you off?

123
00:06:45,653 --> 00:06:46,947
3 million...

124
00:06:46,947 --> 00:06:48,735
You didn't give it to her, right?

125
00:06:48,735 --> 00:06:49,975

She was crying saying that she begged her friend for me

But after the deal, she...

00:09:00,847 --> 00:09:02,155
I don't want to see it!

172
00:09:02,155 --> 00:09:03,772
Why are you acting this way?

173
00:09:03,772 --> 00:09:06,250
Because you are trying to show me what I don't want to see

174
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,374
I am trying to tell you something funny

175
00:09:10,664 --> 00:09:11,670
Nice to meet you guys

176
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,576
I was always just looking through the thread

177
00:09:13,576 --> 00:09:17,801
But I have something to report today, so I decided to write here

178
00:09:19,389 --> 00:09:22,522
From tomorrow, I graduate from the ranks of Single Men

179
00:09:25,001 --> 00:09:26,523
Tiffany, I love...

180
00:09:26,986 --> 00:09:28,736
No, "I love you"
(*"I love you" is in Korean)

181
00:09:29,305 --> 00:09:30,397
Let's get married

182
00:09:30,397 --> 00:09:33,172
I also like Ushijima-san

183
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,070
Thank you

184
00:09:37,915 --> 00:09:38,754
Is this a newbie?

185
00:09:38,754 --> 00:09:42,306
Today, in the train coming back from Akiba event

186
00:09:42,306 --> 00:09:45,296
A drunk man was harassing other passengers

187
00:09:45,296 --> 00:09:49,664
I could not take it anymore, so I gathered up my courage and told him to stop

188
00:09:49,664 --> 00:09:51,269
"Stop..." I said

189
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:53,433
For sure, my voice trembled

190
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:55,684
Because I have never fought before

191
00:09:57,173 --> 00:10:00,221
Don't f**k around with me, you little bastard!

192
00:10:01,837 --> 00:10:05,328
Finally, some salary man came to me and helped me

193
00:10:05,857 --> 00:10:09,117
I didn't look cool... I looked wretched...

194
00:10:09,117 --> 00:10:12,784
Good job, fighting against a drunken man... amazing

195
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:17,731
Well let's go to sleep for tomorrow

196
00:10:26,421 --> 00:10:28,289
Good night, Tiffany

197
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,896
Ushijima-san

198
00:10:38,896 --> 00:10:39,711
Welcome

199
00:10:39,711 --> 00:10:41,201
Oh, Chanel!

200
00:10:41,201 --> 00:10:42,675
Can you go get Tiffany?

201
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:45,689
Tiffany? She stopped working here

202
00:10:45,689 --> 00:10:47,610
Handy, is that for real?

203
00:10:48,112 --> 00:10:49,241
What are you talking about

204
00:10:49,241 --> 00:10:51,063
She had a guy

205
00:10:51,063 --> 00:10:53,283
You were tricked

206
00:10:53,283 --> 00:10:54,480
2 million yen!

207
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,103
You lent it to her, right?

208
00:10:56,103 --> 00:10:57,801
Didn't she leave anything for me?

209
00:10:57,801 --> 00:10:58,591
Nothing...

210
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:00,143
Yeah...

211
00:11:00,143 --> 00:11:01,841
So pitiful~

212
00:11:01,841 --> 00:11:03,260
Pitiful~

213
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,631
Stop it

214
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:05,802
You were tricked~

215
00:11:05,802 --> 00:11:07,178
I said stop it

216
00:11:07,178 --> 00:11:08,954
You dumbass!

217
00:11:10,068 --> 00:11:13,027
What Tiffany!

218
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,323
I don't know any Tiffany!

219
00:11:16,332 --> 00:11:18,194
How dare you say that wretched name!

220
00:11:19,343 --> 00:11:21,541
Something... something big happened!

221
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:27,595
I got a present and a letter from the young woman

222
00:11:27,595 --> 00:11:30,706
The present, it came!!!!

223
00:11:30,706 --> 00:11:33,072
The present is... a pair of tea cups,

224
00:11:33,072 --> 00:11:36,879
A cute envelope, a stationery, and some words

225
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:41,186
Wow~ It smells nice~

226
00:11:41,186 --> 00:11:45,061
No... My face is getting all hot!

227
00:11:45,061 --> 00:11:46,191
Calm down!

228
00:11:46,191 --> 00:11:47,225
Calm down

229
00:11:47,225 --> 00:11:49,183
The smell is probably just an illusion

230
00:11:49,183 --> 00:11:52,328
Can you see if you have any hope from the letter?

231
00:11:52,328 --> 00:11:56,515
She wrote that she was touched by my courage...

232
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:58,347
Just that sentence? Very ambiguous...

233
00:11:58,347 --> 00:11:59,466
Oh, now that I think of it...

234
00:11:59,466 --> 00:12:01,707
If you got it by delivery, you must have her phone number?

235
00:12:01,707 --> 00:12:03,056
Oh, I can do that!

236
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,876
Where is it...

237
00:12:08,911 --> 00:12:11,537
On, on, on the delivery form, a cell phone number...!

238
00:12:12,281 --> 00:12:13,927
No...

239
00:12:13,927 --> 00:12:16,776
I can't call a girl... OTL

240
00:12:16,776 --> 00:12:19,963
What is he saying in front of me...

241
00:12:19,963 --> 00:12:21,884
I...

242
00:12:21,884 --> 00:12:24,166
Can't even call her

243
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,051
Punch those numbers in!

244
00:12:29,051 --> 00:12:30,796
Think about it after you are connected

245
00:12:30,796 --> 00:12:32,181
I think it is impossible...

246
00:12:32,181 --> 00:12:35,043
People do not change that simply!

247
00:12:35,043 --> 00:12:37,381
You make me mad, geez!

248
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:40,221
I need bigger courage now than before

249
00:12:40,221 --> 00:12:41,588
My hands are trembling

250
00:12:41,588 --> 00:12:42,810
My face is all hot

251
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,716
My heart is about to explode!

252
00:12:44,716 --> 00:12:47,741
All talk! Do something!

253
00:12:47,741 --> 00:12:49,279
I am only going to say one thing

254
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,568
She is by herself...

255
00:12:51,568 --> 00:12:54,637
But we are all with you

256
00:12:54,637 --> 00:12:55,782
That is how it works

257
00:12:57,561 --> 00:13:01,621
Sending a pair of cups means she wants you!

258
00:13:01,621 --> 00:13:04,129
But do you know what brand of cup it is?

259
00:13:04,606 --> 00:13:05,843
On the cup

260
00:13:05,843 --> 00:13:06,394

266
00:13:11,028 --> 00:13:12,782
Which kitchen ware brand is it?

267
00:13:12,782 --> 00:13:14,293

It's a brand name item!

I can't stop trembling

273

There is nothing for you to lose!

274
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:35,121
Trust her heart!

00:17:12,222 --> 00:17:16,489
And Hermes became Yakushimaru Hiroko in Matsunaga-shi's imagination

342
00:17:16,489 --> 00:17:18,116
But I have so much time...

343
00:17:18,116 --> 00:17:21,268
Densha Otoko is going to go on a meeting...
(*Meeting: Group Blind Date)

344
00:17:21,268 --> 00:17:23,456
Anyway, can you go back to your house now?
(*Meeting: Group Blind Date)

345
00:17:23,456 --> 00:17:25,041
Don't say such heartless things

346
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,412
I ordered sushi to celebrate my move-in!

347
00:17:27,412 --> 00:17:28,621
Celebrating your move-in?

348
00:17:28,621 --> 00:17:30,985
Until when are you going to stay here?!

349
00:17:30,985 --> 00:17:32,431
Sushi is here!

350
00:17:32,431 --> 00:17:34,106
I have been waiting~

351
00:17:34,106 --> 00:17:35,360
What is this!

352
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,454
I ordered a on-site sushi service...

353
00:17:37,454 --> 00:17:41,024
My girlfriend likes herring roe

354
00:17:41,024 --> 00:17:43,829
Wasting money again...

355
00:17:45,687 --> 00:17:46,768
Ah, Yamada-shi!

356
00:17:46,768 --> 00:17:49,172
Sorry for calling so suddenly but

357
00:17:49,172 --> 00:17:53,340
You want to go on a meeting now?

358
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,089
A meeting?

359
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:55,471
You mean with us?

360
00:17:55,471 --> 00:17:57,709
And can you somehow hide your otaku...

361
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,247
That is asking too much...

362
00:17:59,247 --> 00:18:00,396
Can you somehow...

363
00:18:00,396 --> 00:18:01,375
Please

364
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:04,825
Even if it is Yamada-shi asking, we can't do that

365
00:18:04,825 --> 00:18:07,186
A meeting at the same time...

366
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:10,251
Maybe Yamada-shi is Densha Otoko...

367
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:14,230
What... did you say now?

368
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,970
Nono~

369
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,098
No way~

370
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,008
No, nothing

371
00:18:20,008 --> 00:18:23,980
Anyway, I decided not to love anyone now

372
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,267
We will never go

373
00:18:26,016 --> 00:18:27,486
Ah, hello? Hello?

374
00:18:27,486 --> 00:18:28,953
Matsunaga-shi? Kawamoto-shi?

375
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,328
Why?

376
00:18:34,749 --> 00:18:35,758
I don't know

377
00:18:47,104 --> 00:18:49,069
Nice to meet you

378
00:18:49,478 --> 00:18:50,557
Nice meeting you

379
00:18:51,788 --> 00:18:53,161
Why?

380
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:02,553
Why is this happening?

381
00:19:02,553 --> 00:19:03,695
Senpai, it hurts

382
00:19:03,695 --> 00:19:05,264
Saori just went back with Yamada already

383
00:19:05,264 --> 00:19:06,664
I just wanted to talk at the club

384
00:19:06,664 --> 00:19:08,131
And they bring us here

385
00:19:08,131 --> 00:19:09,243
What is happening?

386
00:19:09,243 --> 00:19:11,026
Senpai, you are killing me!

387
00:19:14,432 --> 00:19:17,132
Wow that was super very good~

388
00:19:17,132 --> 00:19:19,831
It is your turn next~

389
00:19:21,853 --> 00:19:22,364
Where are you going?

390
00:19:22,364 --> 00:19:23,692
Bathroom

391
00:19:23,692 --> 00:19:25,128
If you leave me, I will kill you

392
00:19:25,128 --> 00:19:26,840
I will be back soon

393
00:19:29,906 --> 00:19:31,336
Don't look at the song book

394
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,259
Say something

395
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:34,929
Um... what should I say...

396
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:36,025
Anything

397
00:19:36,025 --> 00:19:37,999
Maybe stories about love...

398
00:19:37,999 --> 00:19:40,853
Actually, I got dumped by a girl not too long ago

399
00:19:42,102 --> 00:19:44,324
I met her on a online dating service

400
00:19:44,324 --> 00:19:47,235
I was tricked into buying a guitar for 3 million yen

401
00:19:47,235 --> 00:19:48,565
3 million?

402
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:51,103
I was tricked

403
00:19:51,103 --> 00:19:52,361
How stupid...

404
00:19:52,361 --> 00:19:55,539
There is no way I can get a girlfriend...

405
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,706
Why are you smiling like a moron?

406
00:20:02,855 --> 00:20:06,390
Why aren't you trying to show her a different side of you? Even after being shamed like that

407
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,430
Make one or two love songs with that guitar

408
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:11,175
And get a better girl for yourself

409
00:20:11,175 --> 00:20:13,199
Why am I preaching at a meeting

410
00:20:18,663 --> 00:20:19,601
Why are you crying!

411
00:20:21,193 --> 00:20:26,735
It is the first time a woman said things like that to me

412
00:20:26,735 --> 00:20:28,543
No, I didn't mean it that way...

413
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:31,387
Thank you... For a person like me...

414
00:20:31,387 --> 00:20:31,954
Nono

415
00:20:31,954 --> 00:20:33,167
I will show you something

416
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,948
Sea turtle laying eggs!

417
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:45,197
Laying eggs!

418
00:20:58,869 --> 00:21:02,026
Yuko-san will never send you a mail

419
00:21:02,026 --> 00:21:04,295
It was going so well then, why?

420
00:21:04,295 --> 00:21:07,584
There must have been a deep reason to have us come out

421
00:21:07,584 --> 00:21:10,318
Anyway, why don't you finish the book to sell at the Comiket

422
00:21:10,318 --> 00:21:10,888
Um...

423
00:21:10,888 --> 00:21:13,319
Densha Otoko posted something...

424
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:14,148
What are you talking about?

425
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:16,984
Densha Otoko probably is invited over to Hermes's house by now

426
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,010
But this...

427
00:21:19,427 --> 00:21:22,572
I, I am at Hermes-san's house right now

428
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:26,087
What? Y, you're not looking at it with Hermes, are you?

429
00:21:26,087 --> 00:21:28,052
No, I'm hiding it

430
00:21:28,052 --> 00:21:31,447
Live from Hermes-san's house!!

431
00:21:31,447 --> 00:21:34,176
Idiot!  What if she catches you?

432
00:21:34,176 --> 00:21:36,317
Shut it down now!!  What do you think you're doing?

433
00:21:36,317 --> 00:21:38,692
But I forgot what my lines were...

434
00:21:38,692 --> 00:21:40,678
Is English tea ok?

435
00:21:40,678 --> 00:21:41,944
Y, yes

436
00:21:41,944 --> 00:21:43,702
Please choose one of these

437
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:44,656
Okay

438
00:21:46,688 --> 00:21:49,245
She just brought in these cans of English tea

439
00:21:49,245 --> 00:21:51,096
This is dangerous, I am getting excited because it is too real

440
00:21:51,096 --> 00:21:54,130
I guess her household drinks really expensive tea

441
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,785
It says BE-NO-IST

442
00:21:55,785 --> 00:21:57,292
Benoist?

443
00:21:57,292 --> 00:22:01,448
Benoist. Established in the 19th century, they provide the finest in food and drink

444
00:22:01,448 --> 00:22:02,733
Intelligence, thanks for the info

445
00:22:02,733 --> 00:22:04,886
They cater to the British royalty!!!!

446
00:22:04,886 --> 00:22:07,379
Benoist Tea, yes-----!!

447
00:22:07,379 --> 00:22:08,900
Have you decided yet?

448
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,662
Yes

449
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,403
I'll go with the Benoist

450
00:22:11,403 --> 00:22:13,001
They're all Benoist

451
00:22:14,552 --> 00:22:16,414
Um, I'll go with this

452
00:22:16,414 --> 00:22:17,585
Darjeeling?

453
00:22:17,585 --> 00:22:19,274
I like it too

454
00:22:19,274 --> 00:22:20,378
Yes

455
00:22:21,156 --> 00:22:22,469
Hermes

456
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,253
Huh?

457
00:22:24,253 --> 00:22:25,278
Hermes?

458
00:22:25,278 --> 00:22:25,864
Hermes??

459
00:22:25,864 --> 00:22:26,895
Hermes???

460
00:22:26,895 --> 00:22:29,486
Hermes????

461
00:22:29,486 --> 00:22:31,601
[Benoist]

462
00:22:35,379 --> 00:22:38,365
Densha

463
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:44,349
I am still holding on

464
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,400
Hermes...

465
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:58,552
Hermes bag and Benoist tea

466
00:23:01,989 --> 00:23:04,299
25 years old, black straight hair

467
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,024
Skinny...

468
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,488
White complexion...

469
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,518
Bright looking...

470
00:23:11,518 --> 00:23:13,380
Is she...

471
00:23:14,423 --> 00:23:16,531
Hermes?

472
00:23:19,656 --> 00:23:22,339
Excuse me but... do you like Benoist tea?

473
00:23:22,339 --> 00:23:23,291
No... that is not the...

474
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:24,783
You don't have to hide it

475
00:23:24,783 --> 00:23:27,134
And you like Darjeeling?

476
00:23:27,134 --> 00:23:28,716
I said no...

477
00:23:28,716 --> 00:23:30,553
Don't worry, I know it all

478
00:23:30,553 --> 00:23:32,822
Anyway, would you like to have dinner with me?

479
00:23:32,822 --> 00:23:33,931
Please stop it

480
00:23:33,931 --> 00:23:35,451
If not a dinner, then how about a cup of coffee...

481
00:23:35,451 --> 00:23:37,412
I am running Healthy Drinking Bar near the next station

482
00:23:37,412 --> 00:23:38,584
Stop it

483
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:44,316
What?

484
00:23:44,316 --> 00:23:46,450
I,I... I am telling you... to stop it

485
00:23:47,457 --> 00:23:48,763
What are you saying?

486
00:23:48,763 --> 00:23:50,758
She... she is telling you to st.. stop it...

487
00:23:50,758 --> 00:23:52,354
No this is...

488
00:23:52,354 --> 00:23:53,077
A miraculous...

489
00:23:53,077 --> 00:23:54,175
Ouch!

490
00:23:54,175 --> 00:23:54,646
Ouch ouch!

491
00:23:54,646 --> 00:23:55,648
What are you doing?

492
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,094
Calm down and sit

493
00:23:57,094 --> 00:23:58,329
Sit, geez!

494
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:00,077
Ouch ouch...

495
00:24:00,077 --> 00:24:01,856
Why are you resisting?

496
00:24:02,626 --> 00:24:04,400
Sit down!

497
00:24:06,015 --> 00:24:07,765
I don't have arthritis...

498
00:24:07,765 --> 00:24:09,429
You look wretched

499
00:24:09,429 --> 00:24:10,595
Act your age

500
00:24:10,595 --> 00:24:12,241
What are you guys!

501
00:24:12,694 --> 00:24:14,144
Give up! Give up!

502
00:24:14,144 --> 00:24:15,067
This man was causing trouble?

503
00:24:15,067 --> 00:24:15,732
Yes

504
00:24:15,732 --> 00:24:16,919
What do you mean, "yes"?

505
00:24:18,781 --> 00:24:21,230
Huh?

506
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:23,191
Huh? This situation is...

507
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:39,098
When did you make a copy of the key?

508
00:24:39,665 --> 00:24:42,706
Wow, we couldn't sell any of the "Ankle Princess"

509
00:24:42,706 --> 00:24:45,708
Well that isn't a problem since we predicted it

510
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:48,837
But I am worried about the scary mood between Yamada-shi and Aoyama-san

511
00:24:48,837 --> 00:24:51,670
Even sea turtle laying eggs didn't work

512
00:24:52,256 --> 00:24:54,436
Matsunaga-shi

513
00:24:54,436 --> 00:24:56,683
I think Densha Otoko got dumped

514
00:24:56,683 --> 00:24:58,049
What?

515
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:02,552
Densha Otoko also got dumped at the comiket? With Hermes?

516
00:25:03,116 --> 00:25:04,725
Wait a minute...

517
00:25:04,725 --> 00:25:07,901
Maybe... Yamada-shi is Densha Otoko?

518
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,719
Nono no way~

519
00:25:16,401 --> 00:25:18,736
Densha...

520
00:25:18,736 --> 00:25:20,773
Is this the end for him?

521
00:25:21,443 --> 00:25:23,187
What are you talking about?

522
00:25:23,187 --> 00:25:25,749
Nothing, I am talking to myself

523
00:25:26,074 --> 00:25:28,876
Anyway, what did you have to tell me?

524
00:25:28,876 --> 00:25:32,364
Actually, Tiffany called us

525
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,143
Really?

526
00:25:33,143 --> 00:25:35,587
She is working at a shop in Kabukichou
(*Kabukichou is a district in Shinjuku, Tokyo)

527
00:25:35,587 --> 00:25:36,547
And?
(*Kabukichou is a district in Shinjuku, Tokyo)

528
00:25:36,547 --> 00:25:39,785
But I am sure she has a boyfriend

529
00:25:39,785 --> 00:25:42,865
If not, she wouldn't have stayed in Tokyo

530
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:46,197
I know that much...

531
00:25:48,086 --> 00:25:49,285
I know...

532
00:26:02,304 --> 00:26:03,995
Long time no see...

533
00:26:12,616 --> 00:26:16,153
Can you even pay back the interest for 2 million yen?

534
00:26:16,153 --> 00:26:18,376
I am sorry...

535
00:26:20,648 --> 00:26:21,463
That is...

536
00:26:21,463 --> 00:26:22,861
Not that...

537
00:26:26,369 --> 00:26:28,389
You have something of worth here

538
00:26:28,389 --> 00:26:31,552
I will take it as this month's interest

539
00:26:32,473 --> 00:26:34,398
Wait there!

540
00:26:34,398 --> 00:26:37,121
Please, not that!

541
00:26:44,825 --> 00:26:46,321
F**k off, bastard!

542
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:57,445
Are you really giving this to me?

543
00:26:57,445 --> 00:27:01,804
I don't know the details... but it is for your dream, right?

544
00:27:02,683 --> 00:27:04,847
I like Ushijima-san!

545
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:07,887
Haha, all talks~

546
00:27:07,887 --> 00:27:10,820
It is not because of the money

547
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,288
Whatever~

548
00:27:12,288 --> 00:27:14,277
You say that to other men too

549
00:27:14,277 --> 00:27:15,946
No~

550
00:27:15,946 --> 00:27:20,183
I only say "I like you" to one person

551
00:27:20,878 --> 00:27:22,496
Okay okay

552
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:24,292
Let's drink tonight!

553
00:27:39,108 --> 00:27:40,125
This world...

554
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:43,093
No way it is that easy...

555
00:27:52,659 --> 00:27:57,294
I met Hermes-san by accident today,
and it's all clear now

556
00:27:57,294 --> 00:28:01,240
She's was irreplaceable to me

557
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,788
And this is true even now

558
00:28:04,788 --> 00:28:06,459
I can't let it end this way

559
00:28:07,682 --> 00:28:08,662
Densha

560
00:28:12,321 --> 00:28:14,169
Well said, Densha!!

561
00:28:14,169 --> 00:28:16,686
I was waiting for you to say that!

562
00:28:26,273 --> 00:28:28,741
Did you find some handsome new idol??

563
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:30,733
Ah, yes something like that

564
00:28:32,288 --> 00:28:35,700
[Special on Super Rich People]
[No. 4 Matsunaga Yuusaku (30)]
[Annual Income 30 million yen! Owner of Huge Land in Nagoya!]

565
00:28:36,164 --> 00:28:38,753
Annual Income, 30 million?!

566
00:28:38,753 --> 00:28:40,166
Maybe he is a treasure!

567
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,892
Yes, Densha Otoko!

568
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,734
Showing his otaku-ness to Hermes!

569
00:28:54,561 --> 00:28:56,775
This is Mizuki Yuko, we met at the meeting before

570
00:28:56,775 --> 00:28:58,290
Sorry for the late reply

571
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:03,234
I couldn't get Matsunaga-san out of my head, so I am sending a mail

572
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:06,565
Are you okay?

573
00:29:06,565 --> 00:29:08,650
No, nothing

574
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:10,465
Your eyes are swiveling around

575
00:29:11,354 --> 00:29:13,093
What are you hiding?

576
00:29:13,093 --> 00:29:14,526
No just...

577
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,393
What is this

578
00:29:16,393 --> 00:29:18,281
No, don't!

579
00:29:18,281 --> 00:29:19,432
It is my hobby

580
00:29:20,863 --> 00:29:22,976
[20 days since fixing computer]

581
00:29:24,351 --> 00:29:26,048
Work work work!

582
00:29:29,849 --> 00:29:31,406
It is done!

583
00:29:31,406 --> 00:29:33,977
I fixed it!

584
00:29:33,977 --> 00:29:37,679
Densha, I am back!

585
00:29:39,023 --> 00:29:42,660
I got completely dumped by Hermes-san

586
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:46,536
This time, it is the end for real

587
00:29:46,536 --> 00:29:49,684
What happened while I was gone?

588
00:29:53,982 --> 00:29:56,178
If I hide that I'm an otaku, I'll be lying to her

589
00:29:56,178 --> 00:29:58,708
You're taking it too seriously, everyone has things they have to hide

590
00:29:58,708 --> 00:30:00,057
An Otaku is what makes you Densha

591
00:30:00,057 --> 00:30:02,184
What's important is trying to be sincere to Hermes

592
00:30:02,184 --> 00:30:02,851
100% getting dumped

593
00:30:02,851 --> 00:30:04,883
Even if it is Hermes, she will hate you

594
00:30:04,883 --> 00:30:07,142
Show her the true spirit of an otaku

595
00:30:07,142 --> 00:30:09,623
I know it's a crazy gamble

596
00:30:09,623 --> 00:30:13,239
But I can't lie to her anymore!

597
00:30:13,716 --> 00:30:17,165
I'm going to come out to Hermes about my otaku

598
00:30:17,165 --> 00:30:19,136
I got to go to Akiba with Hermes-san

599
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,916
What?!

600
00:30:19,916 --> 00:30:21,035
You mean the fortress of otakus,'Akihabara'?

601
00:30:21,035 --> 00:30:21,635
- You mean the fortress of otakus,'Akihabara'?
- Moreover, aren't you showing her too much?

602
00:30:21,635 --> 00:30:22,832
Moreover, aren't you showing her too much?

603
00:30:22,832 --> 00:30:24,620
What is up with this sudden happy-mode

604
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,923
I am excited!

605
00:30:25,923 --> 00:30:28,075
Hermes-san might find out about this forum someday

606
00:30:28,075 --> 00:30:29,579
Hey Densha, this is a quite serious problem

607
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:31,746
If you get caught, you will for sure be hated

608
00:30:32,074 --> 00:30:34,324
This forum

609
00:30:34,324 --> 00:30:35,499
Is my pride

610
00:30:36,961 --> 00:30:38,870
So

611
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,291
Now

612
00:30:40,291 --> 00:30:41,838
I will tell her

613
00:30:41,838 --> 00:30:45,434
About this forum

614
00:30:45,434 --> 00:30:47,334
My precious heart for her

615
00:30:47,334 --> 00:30:49,434
Your precious concerns

616
00:30:52,762 --> 00:30:56,890
By the time I got there, she already found out

617
00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:00,824
I think her brother told her

618
00:31:01,597 --> 00:31:04,322
I think Hermes-san was shocked

619
00:31:04,322 --> 00:31:07,489
At finding stories concerning her here

620
00:31:07,882 --> 00:31:11,873
I couldn't explain anything, just got dumped

621
00:31:13,441 --> 00:31:16,997
After she said to never see her again

622
00:31:16,997 --> 00:31:19,551
I finally realized...

623
00:31:19,551 --> 00:31:20,975
Now

624
00:31:20,975 --> 00:31:23,474
There is no way

625
00:31:23,474 --> 00:31:24,622
To meet her

626
00:31:24,622 --> 00:31:26,097
What are you talking about!

627
00:31:26,097 --> 00:31:29,761
You still have a chance! Unlike me!

628
00:31:29,761 --> 00:31:31,303
That's enough

629
00:31:31,303 --> 00:31:32,943
You did good

630
00:31:32,943 --> 00:31:36,972
Singles saying things about what you decided

631
00:31:36,972 --> 00:31:37,530
Would not have any meaning anymore

632
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:38,597
- Would not have any meaning anymore
- I know it is hard for you

633
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:40,134
But don't stop now. You can find other girls!

634
00:31:40,134 --> 00:31:40,952
No!

635
00:31:40,952 --> 00:31:41,992
I can't accept things ending this way!

636
00:31:41,992 --> 00:31:42,823
- I can't accept things ending this way!
- Densha...

637
00:31:42,823 --> 00:31:44,869
Let's go back to the origin of all single males!

638
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:45,893
Densha Otoko!

639
00:31:45,893 --> 00:31:46,358
The End!

640
00:31:46,358 --> 00:31:49,860
The three months I spent with Densha are my treasures!

641
00:31:50,363 --> 00:31:51,598
Now

642
00:31:51,598 --> 00:31:54,336
I won't write here anymore

643
00:31:54,336 --> 00:31:56,820
But I won't forget you guys

644
00:31:59,387 --> 00:32:02,388
Thank you

645
00:32:33,504 --> 00:32:36,882
Densha Otoko is done with now

646
00:32:36,882 --> 00:32:39,199
So why don't you go back to Nagoya now?

647
00:32:39,199 --> 00:32:41,238
No, I still have something to do

648
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:47,891
Wait, what are you doing?

649
00:32:47,891 --> 00:32:48,673
Who are you talking to over the mail?

650
00:32:48,673 --> 00:32:50,113
Brush your teeth before going to sleep

651
00:32:50,113 --> 00:32:51,386
Yuko-san

652
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,056
Moreover, the mail says...

653
00:32:53,056 --> 00:32:54,772
"Brush your teeth before going to sleep"??

654
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:57,027
You guys are sending mails like a couple!

655
00:32:57,027 --> 00:32:58,457
Stop it

656
00:32:58,457 --> 00:33:00,498
Did you already meet her several times?

657
00:33:00,498 --> 00:33:02,598
No, not once since the meeting

658
00:33:02,598 --> 00:33:03,658
Why

659
00:33:03,658 --> 00:33:06,100
Meeting up with her is better than mailing

660
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,296
I don't want to be scammed again!

661
00:33:08,296 --> 00:33:10,801
I really will be wretched if I get tricked again

662
00:33:10,801 --> 00:33:14,124
"Again"? Did something happen before?

663
00:33:14,124 --> 00:33:15,369
No...

664
00:33:20,315 --> 00:33:24,860
I feel some mysterious power from the forum

665
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:28,786
Yes, as if it is saying it's not over yet

666
00:33:29,211 --> 00:33:32,370
Why did you guys let Densha go with unfinished business?

667
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:35,189
This way, he won't have changed at all

668
00:33:35,189 --> 00:33:37,965
I am also not sure that things will work out

669
00:33:37,965 --> 00:33:38,822
But

670
00:33:38,822 --> 00:33:41,084
I don't want any regrets

671
00:33:41,084 --> 00:33:44,758
He never told Hermes-san how he actually feels

672
00:33:44,758 --> 00:33:47,676
He can give up after he tells her

673
00:33:48,511 --> 00:33:50,320
But it is too late now

674
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,693
Densha will never come back to this forum

675

That is why we are called singles

677
00:34:00,553 --> 00:34:04,510
Unless we change, we can't hope to change Densha's mind!

678
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:07,189
Is there anyone that will get him to come here

679
00:34:07,189 --> 00:34:10,562
And tell him to confess!! Anyone!!!

How about Undercover Akiba project?

683
00:34:22,723 --> 00:34:24,951
Densha told me he lives on the Chuo Line

684
00:34:24,951 --> 00:34:25,996
I will wait at the station!

685
00:34:25,996 --> 00:34:27,600
I will be the announcer at the station!

686
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,437
I will do a live street performance in Akiba

687
00:34:30,437 --> 00:34:32,970
I will shout Densha in the middle of Akiba

688
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:35,269
I will call him 3000 feet above the ground!

689
00:34:35,269 --> 00:34:37,404
I will write his story and publish it!

690
00:34:37,404 --> 00:34:39,013
I will also call for people at Akiba

691
00:34:39,013 --> 00:34:41,558
I will buy the whole Akiba to find him

692
00:34:41,558 --> 00:34:45,086
Then I will call him on the TV

693
00:34:45,086 --> 00:34:45,841
All right!

00:43:26,815 --> 00:43:28,006
Densha-san...

840
00:43:28,673 --> 00:43:32,653
Thinking about me in such ways...

841
00:43:32,653 --> 00:43:35,387
I was so happy!

842
00:43:39,531 --> 00:43:43,392
All the people at the forum are all so nice

843
00:43:46,809 --> 00:43:47,891
Yes

844
00:43:49,497 --> 00:43:51,042
So...

845
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,651
I came...

846
00:43:56,202 --> 00:44:00,036
To formally listen to what is in your heart...

847
00:44:06,451 --> 00:44:09,435
Can you...

848
00:44:09,435 --> 00:44:10,751
Can you... tell me?

849
00:44:12,261 --> 00:44:13,246
Yes...

850
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:21,562
I.I.I..I have something important to say

851
00:44:22,084 --> 00:44:22,661
Yes

852
00:44:25,207 --> 00:44:30,680
Everything was shining when I was with Hermes-san

853
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:36,294
But...

854
00:44:37,863 --> 00:44:42,041
I... didn't have anything...

855
00:44:42,041 --> 00:44:43,901
Couldn't do anything for you...

856
00:44:47,471 --> 00:44:48,773
But...

857
00:44:50,858 --> 00:44:51,992
But...!

858
00:44:53,908 --> 00:44:56,928
My heart caring for Hermes-san!

859
00:44:59,772 --> 00:45:03,060
Compared to anyone's...

860
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,319
There can be no less!

861
00:45:07,591 --> 00:45:09,025
I.....

862
00:45:13,895 --> 00:45:15,102
I......

863
00:45:31,487 --> 00:45:32,614
You can do it

864
00:45:34,395 --> 00:45:35,733
I....

865
00:45:39,249 --> 00:45:40,211
I.....!

866
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:47,990
He.He.. Hermes-san...

867
00:45:53,113 --> 00:45:54,671
L.L..Like Hermes-san!

868
00:46:10,103 --> 00:46:12,961
I also...

869
00:46:12,961 --> 00:46:16,521
Like...

870
00:46:16,521 --> 00:46:17,782
Densha-san!

871
00:46:21,629 --> 00:46:24,242
So

872
00:46:24,242 --> 00:46:25,585
Even from now on...

873
00:46:25,585 --> 00:46:29,445
Will you always be with me?

874
00:46:33,606 --> 00:46:34,763
Yes!!

875
00:46:36,573 --> 00:46:38,639
I started crying with you...

876
00:46:48,035 --> 00:46:49,771
What are you doing?!

877
00:46:52,103 --> 00:46:54,171
After saying I like you...

878
00:46:54,171 --> 00:46:56,102
I like you even more

879
00:47:06,082 --> 00:47:08,298
Is everyone still alive?

880
00:47:16,815 --> 00:47:18,919
It was a huge bombing...

881
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:22,505
I didn't know the the final weapon was this... strong

882
00:47:22,505 --> 00:47:25,025
F..F... Finally, love has been fulfilled!

883
00:47:25,025 --> 00:47:26,772
Let him continue ranting

884
00:47:26,772 --> 00:47:28,190
B..But

885
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:30,052
So nice that it all worked out

886
00:47:30,052 --> 00:47:34,200
Otaku single man becoming a couple...

887
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,280
Now Densha is way ahead of us

888
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,761
So let's graduate him from this thread!

889
00:47:40,761 --> 00:47:42,807
Because he is not a single man anymore, right?

890
00:47:42,807 --> 00:47:45,670
So our part is over

891
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:47,931
I will be alone again

892
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:51,482
Hey... Can't Densha stay here?

893
00:47:51,482 --> 00:47:52,507
Right

894
00:47:52,507 --> 00:47:54,337
Couples are taking part in this too

895
00:47:54,337 --> 00:47:56,645
Wouldn't Densha also want to stay?

896
00:47:56,645 --> 00:47:57,984
No way

897
00:47:57,984 --> 00:47:59,936
This way, if anything happens to Densha

898
00:47:59,936 --> 00:48:01,474
He will come looking for our help

899
00:48:01,474 --> 00:48:04,467
It doesn't help him grow

900
00:48:04,467 --> 00:48:08,517
Densha gave us all something

901
00:48:08,517 --> 00:48:14,620
Shouldn't we give his new start tons of blessings?

902
00:48:21,485 --> 00:48:24,551
Sorry, I am a little late

903
00:48:24,551 --> 00:48:28,205
Hermes-san said "I wish everyday were Sunday"

904
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:29,911
In the mail that she just sent

905
00:48:29,911 --> 00:48:31,644
I am so happy~

906
00:48:31,644 --> 00:48:33,696
Sorry but please say that kind of stuff in the Couple Zone

907
00:48:33,696 --> 00:48:35,468
Now ranting is over

908
00:48:35,468 --> 00:48:38,643
We are not that free to listen to your ranting forever

909
00:48:38,643 --> 00:48:42,458
Go away before this thread becomes a "1000 reply thread"

910
00:48:42,458 --> 00:48:46,319
Huh? Things seem a little cold here... Is it just me?

911
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:48,702
Densha, listen to me

912
00:48:48,702 --> 00:48:51,632
You are not a single man anymore

913
00:48:51,632 --> 00:48:55,714
Which means, it is time for you to graduate

914
00:48:55,714 --> 00:48:58,803
Now we will not look over you anymore

915
00:48:58,803 --> 00:49:01,403
I want you to stay, but I think it is time to say goodbye

916
00:49:01,403 --> 00:49:03,439
Why?

917
00:49:03,439 --> 00:49:05,598
Finally, we became companions

918
00:49:07,425 --> 00:49:10,807
That makes me feel lonely again

919
00:49:10,807 --> 00:49:13,215
We are saying this because we are your companions

920
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:15,253
You must take a new step now

921
00:49:15,253 --> 00:49:16,707
You are not alone anymore

922
00:49:16,707 --> 00:49:17,555
Be strong!

923
00:49:17,555 --> 00:49:20,597
Who will protect Hermes-san if you don't protect her?

924
00:49:25,998 --> 00:49:28,518
All right

925
00:49:29,284 --> 00:49:30,881
I...

926
00:49:30,881 --> 00:49:32,017
Will leave

926
00:49:41,308 --> 00:49:44,444
Well said, Densha

927
00:49:45,214 --> 00:49:48,681
Everyone! Tell him your feelings!

928
00:49:48,681 --> 00:49:52,719
This is the single man's graduation!

929
00:49:53,631 --> 00:49:54,166
Densha...

930
00:49:54,166 --> 00:49:55,461
I understood through you

931
00:49:55,461 --> 00:49:57,874
That I can't always stay as a supporter

932
00:49:57,874 --> 00:50:01,543
So I will find my love on the field

933
00:50:01,543 --> 00:50:03,941
You guys are really... Benoist!!

934
00:50:03,941 --> 00:50:06,105
I always shouted "Hermes, moe~!"

935
00:50:06,105 --> 00:50:08,618
But for today, Densha moe~!

936
00:50:08,618 --> 00:50:10,614
I can't stop here either

937
00:50:10,614 --> 00:50:13,867
No more loose socks! Now panty hose!

938
00:50:13,867 --> 00:50:15,182
Last train!

939
00:50:15,182 --> 00:50:16,139
Last train!

940
00:50:16,139 --> 00:50:18,711

Densha, you write the 1000th reply

943
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:32,612
Soon...

944
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:33,783
It is good-bye...

985

00:50:37,569 --> 00:50:40,073

I also want to confess to Yuko-san

968
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:19,183
What are you talking about Matsunaga-shi?

969
00:52:19,183 --> 00:52:22,756
I was running away because I was afraid of getting hurt

970
00:52:22,756 --> 00:52:24,559
What happened to you suddenly?

You are alive!

00:52:49,967 --> 00:52:54,749
Actually, I have been following Densha Otoko silently

979
00:52:54,749 --> 00:52:58,841
Because of him, I think I can stand up on my feet once more

980
00:52:58,841 --> 00:53:02,002
Tomorrow at 7PM, in front of Tokyo Dome

981
00:53:02,002 --> 00:53:05,549
I will confess tomorrow through the big screen

982
00:53:05,549 --> 00:53:06,748
I will write what I intend to say here

983
00:53:07,803 --> 00:53:11,892
Isn't it too much telling where to confess?

984
00:53:11,892 --> 00:53:15,422
If I don't do this much, I don't think I will be able to do it

985
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:19,607
Confession through the big screen!

986
00:53:19,607 --> 00:53:22,322
This is even bigger than Densha Otoko's graduation!

987
00:53:22,322 --> 00:53:25,187
And he even disclosed the time, what is he thinking?

988
00:53:25,187 --> 00:53:26,115
I think she is just a scam

989
00:53:26,115 --> 00:53:28,394
I know I am taking a risk

990
00:53:28,394 --> 00:53:31,594
But my intuition tells me she is the right person

991
00:53:31,594 --> 00:53:35,798
I don't deserve her because she is such an awesome person

992
00:53:35,798 --> 00:53:39,926
So to make my intention stronger, I wanted to tell everyone about it

993

I will send her a mail now

00:55:10,996 --> 00:55:12,092
But for some reason...

1006
00:55:12,092 --> 00:55:14,844
Even if it just sending mails for over 100 times

1007
00:55:14,844 --> 00:55:16,546
You get familiar with him...

1008
00:55:16,546 --> 00:55:19,035
Maybe it is just a maternal feeling

1009
00:55:19,035 --> 00:55:23,572
I can't just leave him like that

1010
00:55:24,668 --> 00:55:27,252
Well, it is all over anyway, okay?

1011
00:55:27,252 --> 00:55:29,427
Okay okay

1012
00:55:46,308 --> 00:55:47,356
Frendy

1013
00:55:47,356 --> 00:55:48,264
Ushijima-san

1014
00:55:48,264 --> 00:55:49,591
You are really early today!

1015
00:55:49,591 --> 00:55:50,936
What is going on?

1016
00:55:50,936 --> 00:55:52,336
Sorry

1017
00:55:52,336 --> 00:55:54,976
Which store in Kabukichou is Tiffany at?

1018
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:56,417
Ushijima-san, even if you go...

1019
00:55:56,417 --> 00:55:57,858
Even if she has a boyfriend, it doesn't matter

1020
00:55:57,858 --> 00:56:00,010
I trust Tiffany

1021
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:03,200
So at least I want to tell her my feelings

1022
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,280
You are so stubborn

1023
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,461
She is in Rick Dome

1024
00:56:06,461 --> 00:56:07,562
Rick Dome

1025
00:56:07,562 --> 00:56:08,409
Okay

1026
00:56:08,409 --> 00:56:10,178
Sorry

1027
00:56:13,914 --> 00:56:16,003
If I read this forum

1028
00:56:16,003 --> 00:56:19,746
I feel like everything will go okay

1029
00:56:19,746 --> 00:56:21,908
So I could gather up my courage

1030
00:56:22,415 --> 00:56:24,523
Because of your advice

1031
00:56:24,523 --> 00:56:26,384
And your support

1032
00:56:26,384 --> 00:56:27,670
I...

1033
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:30,038
I think I grew up a little bit

1034
00:56:33,708 --> 00:56:38,338
Whenever I think of her, I feel more unsecure...

1035
00:56:38,338 --> 00:56:45,133
But you guys gave me courage even though I didn't know your names or faces

1036
00:56:56,148 --> 00:56:59,181
If I didn't write on this forum

1037
00:56:59,181 --> 00:57:03,361
I couldn't have liked myself as I do now

1038
00:57:03,928 --> 00:57:06,034
And moreover

1039
00:57:06,034 --> 00:57:09,339
I couldn't have met

1040
00:57:09,339 --> 00:57:10,709
Such precious friends

1041
00:57:12,658 --> 00:57:16,585
Because always you guys were beside me

1042
00:57:17,702 --> 00:57:19,014
I could

1043
00:57:19,014 --> 00:57:20,166
Try my best

1044
00:57:23,292 --> 00:57:28,088
It is a good thing that I met this thread

1045
00:57:30,766 --> 00:57:35,137
It is a good thing that I spent time with you guys

1046
00:57:40,783 --> 00:57:44,821
Tiffany

1047
00:57:54,599 --> 00:57:56,982
May the light

1048
00:57:56,982 --> 00:57:59,177
Be with you guys

1049
00:58:06,199 --> 00:58:08,162
My dream was becoming a singer

1050
00:58:12,016 --> 00:58:15,720
At the shop, some guy calling himself a manager of an office

1051
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:19,454
Told me to pay him 2 million for signing a contract

1052
00:58:20,508 --> 00:58:22,261
But...

1053
00:58:22,261 --> 00:58:23,599
He never called me back

1054
00:58:24,822 --> 00:58:27,503
So I followed him to Tokyo

1055
00:58:28,990 --> 00:58:31,091
But there was no office

1056
00:58:36,891 --> 00:58:37,908
Sorry

1057
00:58:40,455 --> 00:58:42,682
For lying to you...

1058
00:58:42,682 --> 00:58:46,755
I felt so sorry for Ushijima-san

1059
00:58:46,755 --> 00:58:49,147
I wanted to work to pay you back

1060
00:58:49,147 --> 00:58:51,047
That is enough

1061
00:58:54,848 --> 00:58:56,035
I...

1062
00:58:56,035 --> 00:58:57,489
Don't have any money

1063
00:58:57,489 --> 00:58:59,309
I look wretched

1064
00:58:59,309 --> 00:59:02,328
And all I want is for the Hanshin Tigers to win
(*Hanshin Tigers: a baseball team in Japan)

1065
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:06,150
I don't know that much about Tiffany

1066
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:08,570
Not my style...

1067
00:59:08,570 --> 00:59:10,645
I like slightly bigger breasts

1068
00:59:10,645 --> 00:59:12,278
30 years old...

1069
00:59:12,278 --> 00:59:15,770
Shit, what am I talking about

1070
00:59:15,770 --> 00:59:18,636
I can't think of anything good to say

1071
00:59:20,186 --> 00:59:22,508
It has to be you

1072
00:59:22,508 --> 00:59:24,300
I will make you happy

1073
00:59:24,695 --> 00:59:27,835
So so...

1074
00:59:31,107 --> 00:59:32,975
Be with me

1075
00:59:40,208 --> 00:59:41,121
Yes!

1076
00:59:48,124 --> 00:59:49,304
Also I...

1077
00:59:49,304 --> 00:59:53,662
Really really like Ushijima-san!

1078
00:59:53,662 --> 00:59:55,125
Really...

1079
00:59:55,125 --> 00:59:56,467
Are you okay even with me?

1080
00:59:56,467 --> 00:59:58,331
I told you before

1081
00:59:58,331 --> 01:00:01,786
I only say "I like you" to one person

1082
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:12,120
Ushijima-san

1083
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:13,567
Laugh

1084
01:00:16,168 --> 01:00:17,818
Being this happy

1085
01:00:18,844 --> 01:00:20,619
Who would be able to laugh?

1086
01:00:26,286 --> 01:00:27,836
Shit

1087
01:00:27,836 --> 01:00:30,167
I have to buy the ring again!

1088
01:00:41,174 --> 01:00:44,164
Sorry but I have to go somewhere

1089
01:00:44,886 --> 01:00:45,439
Where?

1090
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:49,767
It is where another guy who received courage from Densha is

1091
01:01:17,402 --> 01:01:18,570
I am going to go back

1092
01:01:18,570 --> 01:01:20,426
Senpai, be considerate

1093
01:01:20,426 --> 01:01:21,764
It is already 7 o'clock

1094
01:01:32,195 --> 01:01:32,666
Yuko-san

1095
01:01:32,666 --> 01:01:36,648
I will now tell you my feelings

1096
01:01:37,569 --> 01:01:38,993
Is that Guitar Otoko?

1097
01:01:39,742 --> 01:01:41,577
What an otaku!

1098
01:01:41,577 --> 01:01:43,271
He is super Akiba-type

1099
01:01:44,119 --> 01:01:45,414
Guitar Otoko's specifics?

1100
01:01:46,197 --> 01:01:47,963
Looks low

1101
01:01:47,963 --> 01:01:50,430
I came to cheer Guitar Otoko on

1102
01:01:50,430 --> 01:01:52,432
But looks like there is almost no chance

1103
01:01:59,488 --> 01:02:00,867
I am not late

1104
01:02:00,867 --> 01:02:02,259
Finished!

1105
01:02:12,964 --> 01:02:15,783
I first met you

1106
01:02:15,783 --> 01:02:19,596
On some meeting

1107
01:02:19,596 --> 01:02:25,633
I was on fire just from your first impression

1108
01:02:27,338 --> 01:02:30,971
The fall will end soon

1109
01:02:30,971 --> 01:02:34,079
The season of abundance will end soon

1110
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:37,291
So before it all ends

1111
01:02:37,291 --> 01:02:41,022
I will tell you

1112
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:47,248
I like you~

1113
01:02:49,116 --> 01:02:54,391
I really like you~

1114
01:02:54,391 --> 01:02:56,329
That is so creepy

1115
01:02:56,329 --> 01:02:58,674
The single man was full of single-ness

1116
01:02:58,674 --> 01:03:00,314
Why did I even skip my class

1117
01:03:00,314 --> 01:03:01,332
Guitar Otoko, not on fire

1118
01:03:01,332 --> 01:03:03,224
Even I can sing better

1119
01:03:03,224 --> 01:03:04,088
Let's just go back home

1120
01:03:04,088 --> 01:03:06,143
No hope whatsoever

1121
01:03:06,143 --> 01:03:07,315
Give me my money back!

1122
01:03:07,315 --> 01:03:08,900
Well, I didn't pay...

1123
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:11,145
I can't take this anymore

1124
01:03:11,145 --> 01:03:12,769
I hope she didn't come

1125
01:03:13,855 --> 01:03:17,708
So I will tell you before it all ends

1126
01:03:17,708 --> 01:03:19,353
This is too much

1127
01:03:19,353 --> 01:03:20,855
Let's go back

1128
01:03:21,771 --> 01:03:23,814
Is there someone called Yuko-san?

1129
01:03:24,303 --> 01:03:25,350
Please listen to me!

1130
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:30,027
There was someone called Guitar Otoko, a typical otaku

1131
01:03:30,027 --> 01:03:32,946
He never went out with any girls

1132
01:03:32,946 --> 01:03:35,038
So to a girl he met at the online-dating service

1133
01:03:35,038 --> 01:03:37,741
He was tricked into buying a guitar for 3 million yen

1134
01:03:37,741 --> 01:03:40,849
So he decided to never love anyone

1135
01:03:42,367 --> 01:03:43,195
But

1136
01:03:43,195 --> 01:03:48,630
He stood up on his feet only because he met you

1137
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:52,799
He stood up to tell you his feelings

1138
01:03:57,662 --> 01:03:59,913
So...

1139
01:03:59,913 --> 01:04:02,292
It might be a horrible performance

1140
01:04:02,292 --> 01:04:07,156
But will you please listen to it until the end?

1141
01:04:19,790 --> 01:04:22,414
He made that for you, senpai...

1142
01:04:22,414 --> 01:04:23,457
Love song...

1143
01:04:26,168 --> 01:04:27,584
I...

1144
01:04:27,584 --> 01:04:29,691
Don't deserve this

1145
01:04:33,225 --> 01:04:37,131
Money was the primary purpose at first

1146
01:04:37,131 --> 01:04:39,397
But it was "at first"

1147
01:04:41,831 --> 01:04:45,262
I only communicated with him through mail

1148
01:04:45,262 --> 01:04:47,881
But over 100 times

1149
01:04:49,358 --> 01:04:55,203
You are my everything

1150
01:04:55,203 --> 01:04:59,496
Just you being with me...

1151
01:04:59,496 --> 01:05:02,442
But still, he is really bad

1152
01:05:02,442 --> 01:05:05,309
I can't even think that he actually practiced

1153
01:05:34,940 --> 01:05:36,573
Not late yet?

1154
01:05:42,383 --> 01:05:44,362
Not late yet, right?

1155
01:05:45,392 --> 01:05:46,398
Yes!

1156
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:00,799
Yes, this is Matsunaga-shi's cellphone

1157
01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:02,773
Tell the pitch-deaf beside you

1158
01:06:03,362 --> 01:06:05,722
To buy me dinner this Sunday

1159
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:13,473
Matsunaga-shi

1160
01:06:14,019 --> 01:06:15,705
Matsunaga-shi!

1161
01:06:15,705 --> 01:06:16,867
Matsunaga-shi

1162
01:06:16,867 --> 01:06:18,664
We did it!

1163
01:06:18,664 --> 01:06:19,935
She called!

1164
01:06:19,935 --> 01:06:21,331
The phone!

1165
01:06:22,678 --> 01:06:23,854
Yuko-san called you!

1166
01:06:23,854 --> 01:06:26,497
To tell you to buy dinner this Sunday!

1167
01:06:28,159 --> 01:06:30,215
YES!!!!!!!!!

1168
01:06:32,205 --> 01:06:36,355
I am for ankles

1169
01:06:36,355 --> 01:06:37,359
Hey everybody

1170
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:42,896
I am for ankles!

1171
01:06:42,896 --> 01:06:45,771
On your ankle

1172
01:06:47,536 --> 01:06:48,217
Want to go drink?

1173
01:06:48,217 --> 01:06:49,034
Yes!

1174
01:07:23,541 --> 01:07:26,095
The dinner was delicious

1175
01:07:26,095 --> 01:07:29,838
Yes, I didn't know it was going to be such a feast!

1176
01:07:30,586 --> 01:07:33,617
I have prepared your beds

1177
01:07:33,617 --> 01:07:36,890
Um... She is staying next door...

1178
01:07:36,890 --> 01:07:40,045
Oh~ I thought you two were sharing a room~

1179
01:07:40,045 --> 01:07:41,447
Just got married?

1180
01:07:41,447 --> 01:07:42,974
N.No...

1181
01:07:42,974 --> 01:07:44,419
No

1182
01:07:44,419 --> 01:07:46,561
But this is fine

1183
01:07:47,201 --> 01:07:48,367
It is cold these days

1184
01:07:49,337 --> 01:07:51,435
So I will place them together

1185
01:07:52,316 --> 01:07:53,890
Thank you

1186
01:07:53,890 --> 01:07:56,769
The bath tub will close soon so please hurry

1187
01:08:00,252 --> 01:08:05,263
Then I will go take a bath

1188
01:08:05,263 --> 01:08:06,316
Yes

1189
01:08:16,611 --> 01:08:18,077
W.W.W.What do I do?

1190
01:08:24,628 --> 01:08:26,638
Everyone, long time no see

1191
01:08:26,638 --> 01:08:28,132
This is emergency!

1192
01:08:28,132 --> 01:08:30,113
I came to a hot springs with Hermes-san

1193
01:08:30,113 --> 01:08:32,654
But things went weird and now we are sharing one room

1194
01:08:33,730 --> 01:08:36,658
What do I do?

1195
01:08:36,658 --> 01:08:40,845
Densha, he came-------('V')-------!!!!!!!!!!!!

1196
01:08:41,765 --> 01:08:43,702
------------------------------
If the light hidden in your tears is turned on

1197
01:08:43,702 --> 01:08:45,116
Geez, he is helpless
------------------------------
If the light hidden in your tears is turned on

1198
01:08:45,116 --> 01:08:46,704
------------------------------
If the light hidden in your tears is turned on

1199
01:08:46,704 --> 01:08:47,682
Just ranting on like that!
------------------------------
If the light hidden in your tears is turned on

1200
01:08:47,682 --> 01:08:49,147
Just ranting on like that!
------------------------------
...

1201
01:08:49,147 --> 01:08:50,581
I told him not to come back
------------------------------
I will talk about warm things in front of your eyes

1202

There is only one thing you can do!
------------------------------
I will talk about warm things in front of your eyes

1205
01:08:55,747 --> 01:08:58,595
There is only one thing you can do!
------------------------------
Even then if our voices

1206
01:08:58,595 --> 01:08:59,369
What was that sudden bombing?
------------------------------
Even then if our voices

1207
01:08:59,369 --> 01:09:01,822
What was that sudden bombing?
------------------------------
Go dry

1208
01:09:01,822 --> 01:09:02,444
I can't forgive him!
------------------------------
...

1209
01:09:02,444 --> 01:09:03,306
I can't forgive him!
------------------------------
At least until the morning comes

1210
01:09:03,306 --> 01:09:05,534
Even I haven't experienced it!
------------------------------
At least until the morning comes

1211
01:09:05,534 --> 01:09:06,727
Densha is becoming an adult!
------------------------------
At least until the morning comes

1212
01:09:06,727 --> 01:09:07,566

I want to sing with someone!

------------------------------
If you say you were fake yesterday

1215
01:09:11,622 --> 01:09:13,729
Ask your parents!
------------------------------
If you say you were fake yesterday

1216
01:09:13,729 --> 01:09:15,957
Can I explain step by step?
------------------------------
If you say you were fake yesterday

1217
01:09:15,957 --> 01:09:17,314
Live coverage please!
------------------------------
If you say you were fake yesterday

1218
01:09:17,314 --> 01:09:19,370
I don't think I am the only one imagining
------------------------------
I will only lose yesterday's scene

1219
01:09:19,370 --> 01:09:21,854
Is Hermes watching this too?
------------------------------
I will only lose yesterday's scene

1220
01:09:21,854 --> 01:09:23,526
------------------------------

1221
01:09:23,526 --> 01:09:23,815
------------------------------
The things connecting the new days

1222
01:09:23,815 --> 01:09:26,295
Um...
------------------------------
The things connecting the new days

1223

There is only  mixed-gender tub... Do you want to come too?
------------------------------
Are new days and myself!

1224
01:09:29,233 --> 01:09:30,147
There is only a mixed-gender tub... Do you want to come too?
------------------------------
I check it for some reason

1225
01:09:30,147 --> 01:09:33,387
------------------------------
I check it for some reason

1226
01:09:33,387 --> 01:09:36,854
------------------------------
The world calls that love!

1227
01:09:36,854 --> 01:09:38,067
Hermes-san just asked me
------------------------------
The thing that connects our heart's voices

1228
01:09:38,067 --> 01:09:40,643
"Do you want to take the bath together?"drftgy
------------------------------
The thing that connects our heart's voices

1229
01:09:40,643 --> 01:09:42,928
Bombing, it came!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
------------------------------
I didn't know that would be this scary!

1230
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:46,709
Bombing, it came!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
------------------------------
Together in one voice

1231
01:09:46,709 --> 01:09:52,258
------------------------------
As if the past until now never existed

1232
01:09:52,258 --> 01:09:54,277
------------------------------
I sing!

1233
01:09:56,863 --> 01:10:06,454
------------------------------
Love and peace!

1234
01:10:06,454 --> 01:10:09,987
------------------------------
Will the flower blossom through sadness

1235
01:10:09,987 --> 01:10:10,977
------------------------------
Us in the new days

------------------------------
Will be known, so I feel~

1239
01:10:16,302 --> 01:10:20,776
------------------------------
For our dreams, the world is

1240
01:10:20,776 --> 01:10:23,477
------------------------------
Waiting for us to shout

1241
01:10:23,477 --> 01:10:26,642
------------------------------
Singing for you

1242
01:10:26,642 --> 01:10:29,107
------------------------------
I didn't know it would be that fearful

1243
01:10:29,107 --> 01:10:31,122
This drama is based on a true story
------------------------------
But us checking each other

1244
01:10:31,122 --> 596:31:34,000
This drama is just a bit based on a true story
------------------------------
But us checking each other
