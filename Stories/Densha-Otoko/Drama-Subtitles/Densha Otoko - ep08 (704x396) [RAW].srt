He'd usually be back by now...

00:01:13,088 --> 00:01:16,099
Maybe Hermes didn't show up and he's wading into the Ocean?

19
00:01:16,099 --> 00:01:20,126
Maybe he was successfull and they stayed the night?

20
00:01:21,046 --> 00:01:23,939
I want to hurry up and know what happened!

21

This is something my brother picked out
for you after a lot of searching.

93
00:06:22,144 --> 00:06:27,461
Before that, he kept bugging me
for advice on what he should get.

You know, ever since I can remember,

97
00:06:47,134 --> 00:06:49,919
I've hated my brother.

98
00:06:50,951 --> 00:06:53,289
But lately,

99
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:56,635
I find myself liking him sometimes.

100
00:06:56,635 --> 00:07:03,310
It's probably because he met you.

101
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:06,277
My brother changed for you.

102
00:07:06,277 --> 00:07:09,819
Nowadays people might say it's not their scene.

103
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:12,521
I thought it was amazing though.

104
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:18,609
I wouldn't ever say it if he was around of course.

105
00:07:22,427 --> 00:07:23,788
So,

106
00:07:25,922 --> 00:07:28,288
if you're just playing around with him,

107
00:07:28,288 --> 00:07:31,349

Ok.

137
00:09:26,344 --> 00:09:29,358
It was just a dream.

138

What are you doing here today?

140
00:09:45,224 --> 00:09:46,062
I came here to ask you for a favour.

141

Favor?

142
00:09:46,614 --> 00:09:48,638
Yeah, it's about Oikawa who works for your company.

143
00:09:48,638 --> 00:09:49,806
What about Oikawa-san?

144
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:54,476
I figured since he was the son of a CEO,
I'd be cool to sleep with him.

145
00:09:54,476 --> 00:09:56,311
But he's pushy.

146
00:09:56,311 --> 00:09:59,254
I'm not talking about his personality, but the other thing.

147
00:09:59,254 --> 00:10:00,520
The other thing?

148
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,456
So I was wondering,

149
00:10:01,456 --> 00:10:03,407
Could you tell him for me?

150
00:10:03,407 --> 00:10:06,719
That I don't really like him or anything.

151
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,289
I couldn't say anything like that.

152
00:10:21,016 --> 00:10:21,839
What are you doing?

153
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,615
Don't worry, I'm just hiding.

154
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,807

155
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:31,799
Yamada,

156
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:34,357
did you just see Jinnkama-san?

157
00:10:35,683 --> 00:10:36,695
No, didn't!

158
00:10:36,695 --> 00:10:38,160
I know what I saw.

159
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,551
You're hiding somewhere!

160
00:10:43,955 --> 00:10:46,026
You have a pretty good thing going there.

161
00:10:46,026 --> 00:10:46,992
Huh?

162
00:10:46,992 --> 00:10:48,083
Uh...well-

163
00:10:48,664 --> 00:10:49,825
Hey, Oikawa-kun's here.

164
00:10:49,825 --> 00:10:50,564
This is how it is.

165
00:10:50,564 --> 00:10:53,297
Oikawa wants to take over as Jinnkama Misuzu's supervisor.

166
00:10:53,297 --> 00:10:54,128
Isn't that right, Oikawa?

167
00:10:54,128 --> 00:10:56,313
Can I take over Jinnkama-san's case?

168
00:10:56,313 --> 00:10:58,571
Sure, if you want.

169
00:10:58,571 --> 00:10:59,673
No, that's no good.

170
00:10:59,673 --> 00:11:00,993
Which is it?

171
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:04,208
Jinnkama-san...just not that.

172
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:04,881
What?

173
00:11:04,881 --> 00:11:05,528
Yamada,

174
00:11:05,528 --> 00:11:08,466
listen to Oikawa-kun's reque-

175
00:11:08,466 --> 00:11:10,002
Scary!

176
00:11:10,248 --> 00:11:12,050
If it's that important...

177
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,256
I don't really want it.

178
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:17,145
Oikawa-kun, Oikawa-kun wait for me!

179
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,810
That was close.

180
00:11:25,463 --> 00:11:28,193
What're getting hard for!?

181
00:11:28,498 --> 00:11:30,202
I'm sorry.

182
00:11:34,858 --> 00:11:39,435
Saori, you met Yamada to break up with him right?

183
00:11:39,435 --> 00:11:41,190
I thought if I didn't make it clear,

184
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:44,587
it would just hurt him more later.

185
00:11:44,587 --> 00:11:45,575
That was good.

186
00:11:45,575 --> 00:11:46,956
I'm proud of you.

187
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:47,922
Really?

188
00:11:47,922 --> 00:11:49,355
It was the right thing to do.

189
00:11:49,355 --> 00:11:51,227
She made it clear that she hates people who lie

190
00:11:51,227 --> 00:11:53,139
and made a clean break with Yamada.

191
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:56,165
But that means you haven't changed at all.

192
00:11:57,196 --> 00:12:01,695
See, your gut reaction to lies will probably stay forever.

193
00:12:01,817 --> 00:12:04,363
It's kind of mean, but it's like a disease.

194
00:12:04,363 --> 00:12:08,553
So instead of just letting it ruin your relationships,

195
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:12,083
shouldn't you be trying to get over it?

196
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,883
Get over it?

197
00:12:14,883 --> 00:12:17,835
Gender: Male

198
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,845
Keyword: Details

199
00:12:24,861 --> 00:12:29,803
Kibonne, Kiborine.  Shouldn't you get over it?

200
00:12:32,656 --> 00:12:33,928
What's with that chicken?

201
00:12:33,928 --> 00:12:37,357
When I entered muscles, it said "fake"!

202
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:39,935
How am I supposed to enter "erotic" with just 2 characters?

203
00:12:39,935 --> 00:12:42,597
When you enter it as a female, it gives you softer replies.

204
00:12:42,597 --> 00:12:44,717
When I entered chick, it made cute crying sounds.

205
00:12:44,717 --> 00:12:48,179
It's just a chicken,
but sometimes it shows this wonderful glimpse of kindness.

206
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:51,590
It's annoying, but it's actually pretty accurate.

207
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,809
A chicken?

208
00:13:21,376 --> 00:13:23,189
This...

209
00:13:34,776 --> 00:13:37,368
Keyword: Munetaka

210
00:13:37,368 --> 00:13:42,225
That's the name of the guy who created the Aladdin Channel BBS.

211
00:13:42,427 --> 00:13:44,634
Keyword: Ryoko

212
00:13:44,634 --> 00:13:46,937
The administrator's waiting for your reply.

213
00:13:46,937 --> 00:13:49,387
Reply to the Single Men's thread.

214
00:13:52,225 --> 00:13:54,506
To the board's administrator:

215
00:13:54,506 --> 00:13:56,983
Maybe you'd recognise me if I said chicken-girl.

216
00:13:56,983 --> 00:14:01,346
I was surprised.  I didn't think you'd still be on this board.

217
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:09,242
You might call it a miracle.

218
00:14:09,242 --> 00:14:13,361
It was a thread you liked,
so I thought you might be following it but...

219
00:14:13,361 --> 00:14:16,986
I'm sorry for using your Chicken without your permission.

220
00:14:16,986 --> 00:14:19,201
Isn't there something else you should be sorry for?

221
00:14:19,201 --> 00:14:21,560
Like suddenly disappearing from sight,

222
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,403
and even changing your cell.

223
00:14:23,403 --> 00:14:25,383
You should have said something.

224
00:14:25,869 --> 00:14:31,326
I could tell you that my business partner took off with our money
and then how I stopped trusting people.

225
00:14:31,926 --> 00:14:33,293
But that would just be an excuse.

226
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,969
There's some shipping going on on the board.

227
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,556
Do this in the couple's thread!

228
00:14:37,556 --> 00:14:39,492
There's nothing going on right now.

229
00:14:39,492 --> 00:14:41,235
Let's see where this goes.

230
00:14:41,235 --> 00:14:43,420
I heard about what happened from Keiko.

231
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,302
Did you find your friend?

232
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:47,510
No, I haven't looked for him.

233
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,804
I wouldn't know what to tell him anyway.

234
00:14:49,804 --> 00:14:51,736
He was someone you trusted wasn't he?

235
00:14:51,736 --> 00:14:53,215
I wonder how much he took?

236
00:14:53,215 --> 00:14:55,717
Idiot, it's not about the money.

237
00:14:55,717 --> 00:14:57,521
I wonder how long ago this was?

238
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,840
Have you started a new company?

239
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,187
If I had that kind of courage,

240
00:15:01,187 --> 00:15:04,047
I wouldn't be approaching you like this.

241
00:15:04,047 --> 00:15:06,026
The guy can't move forward yet.

242
00:15:06,026 --> 00:15:07,551
How sad.

243
00:15:07,797 --> 00:15:09,718
Are you still angry?

244
00:15:09,718 --> 00:15:11,154
He seems to want to get back together.

245
00:15:11,154 --> 00:15:13,283
The chicken tactic was pretty crazy.

246
00:15:13,283 --> 00:15:14,821
He probably isn't serious.

247
00:15:14,821 --> 00:15:17,201
I was furious for around a month.

248
00:15:17,201 --> 00:15:20,470
I couldn't figure out why you'd suddenly disappear.

249
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:24,109
I understood when I heard the reason though.

250
00:15:24,109 --> 00:15:27,070
I want to meet you again.

251
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,382
Good on you.

252
00:15:28,382 --> 00:15:29,773
Come on guy, answer her!

253
00:15:29,773 --> 00:15:31,053
Don't take this seriously.

254
00:15:31,053 --> 00:15:33,462
The guy probably wanted to do something,

255
00:15:33,462 --> 00:15:35,921
but the chance never came up.

256
00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:42,023
I'm sorry.  I'm still not ready.

257
00:15:42,023 --> 00:15:44,973
Why guy?

258
00:15:44,973 --> 00:15:46,076
You're almost there.

259
00:15:46,076 --> 00:15:47,144
I know how you feel.

260
00:15:47,144 --> 00:15:50,221
Don't you feel sorry for your girlfriend who wants to meet you?

261
00:15:50,221 --> 00:15:54,429
By 'yet', do you mean you still want to?

262
00:15:54,429 --> 00:15:57,006
Here's an idea.

263
00:15:57,006 --> 00:15:59,253
If Densha-san's relationship,

264
00:15:59,253 --> 00:16:02,864
-the first relationship on this thread-  succeeds...

265
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,906
Will you meet me?

266
00:16:05,906 --> 00:16:09,538
So if it doesn't work, we don't meet?

267
00:16:11,182 --> 00:16:13,855
I guess so...

268
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:18,718
All right.

269
00:16:23,718 --> 00:16:26,712
What is this delicate atmosphere I'm feeling?

270
00:16:26,712 --> 00:16:29,661
Ok.  I guess we have to cheer on Densha even more now.

271
00:16:29,661 --> 00:16:31,591
Even if it's a lie, I want to believe it's true.

272
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:33,366
The girl's awesome.

273
00:16:33,366 --> 00:16:37,112
All right, let's all wait for Densha to return!

274
00:16:50,548 --> 00:16:51,379
I see,

275
00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:54,541
so she likes men who can surf...

276
00:16:58,964 --> 00:17:00,986
What's this?

277
00:17:03,741 --> 00:17:06,038
Keyword: Marriage

278
00:17:06,772 --> 00:17:08,453
It'll never happen.

279
00:17:08,453 --> 00:17:10,037
You'll be single forever.

280
00:17:10,037 --> 00:17:12,100
Your right hand will be your only friend.

281
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,390
Shut up you f*@k'in chicken!

282
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,285
See here?

283
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:17,298
I'm left-handed.

284
00:17:17,298 --> 00:17:19,316
Doh, I spilled my beer.

285
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,067
Huh?

286
00:17:32,734 --> 00:17:35,858
Matsunaga-shi, what are you doing here?

287
00:17:35,858 --> 00:17:40,258
The original Eva Unit-00 looks smarter
than the later releases doesn't it?

288
00:17:40,258 --> 00:17:43,490
If you become an Otaku again,
I could consider giving it to you.

289
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:45,500
I don't really want it.

290
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,323
This guy's heart-rate seems to tell all.

291
00:17:48,323 --> 00:17:49,708
Kawamoto-shi, when did you-

292
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:54,286
Never sold in stores, this is an alarm clock that uses Mina's voice.

293
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:55,459
I don't need it.

294
00:17:55,459 --> 00:17:56,803
And this!

295
00:17:56,803 --> 00:18:01,261
Soma Megumi, Memories Off; the Second Concert version.

296
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:05,460
And this is Asuka Langley's summer bikini version.

297
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,598
Wicke-

298
00:18:06,598 --> 00:18:08,228
He's close to giving up!

299
00:18:08,228 --> 00:18:10,092
And this is really rare.

300
00:18:10,092 --> 00:18:13,476
Mina's pilot episode DVD!

301
00:18:13,476 --> 00:18:16,090
I...don't...ne-

302
00:18:18,451 --> 00:18:21,066
Yamada-shi!

303
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:22,297
Yamada-shi, what happened?

304
00:18:22,297 --> 00:18:25,567
Isn't this what they call a cardiac arrest?

305
00:18:25,587 --> 00:18:26,817
What'll we do?

306
00:18:26,817 --> 00:18:27,995
Calm down.

307
00:18:27,995 --> 00:18:28,900
I think we're supposed to-

308
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,800
Heart massage?

309
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:34,380
I think his arm is getting rigid.

310
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,212
Next I think we're supposed to-

311
00:18:36,476 --> 00:18:38,034
Mouth to mouth?

312
00:18:41,409 --> 00:18:42,877
What are you doing?

313
00:18:42,877 --> 00:18:44,157
I'm so relieved.

314
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:45,444
He's alive!

315
00:18:45,444 --> 00:18:47,238
No need to thank us.

316
00:18:47,238 --> 00:18:49,493
Argh, it was all soft.

317
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:55,184
[Yamada Atsushi]

318
00:18:56,805 --> 00:18:58,373
I don't want to see your face.

319
00:18:58,373 --> 00:19:00,894
Let me think about this by my self for a while.

320
00:19:00,894 --> 00:19:03,005
If you're just playing around with him,

321
00:19:03,005 --> 00:19:06,021
stop hurting him anymore.

322
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,493
Gouf.

323
00:19:31,493 --> 00:19:33,301
Zaku.

324
00:19:33,301 --> 00:19:35,333
Dom.

325
00:20:05,743 --> 00:20:06,829
You've been dumped.

326
00:20:06,829 --> 00:20:09,331
If you keep hanging around her, you'll just be bothering her.

327
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:11,823
Give it up.

328
00:20:16,534 --> 00:20:18,085
It's been a while.

329
00:20:18,085 --> 00:20:19,898
I have news.

330
00:20:23,646 --> 00:20:25,726
Densha, we've been waiting forever.

331
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:27,870
To all personnel! This is not a drill!

332
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:30,008
I repeat, this is not a drill!

333
00:20:30,849 --> 00:20:33,886
Give us the details!  I'm not giving it up yet!

334
00:20:33,886 --> 00:20:37,692
I was able to meet Hermes-san,

335
00:20:37,692 --> 00:20:42,125
but I fell sick and hardly got to talk to her.

336
00:20:43,097 --> 00:20:49,592
Then while I was in the hospital,
I met someone who says he's Hermes-san's fiance.

337
00:20:49,592 --> 00:20:53,503
I was told that I was just bothering her, so I should leave her alone.

338
00:20:53,503 --> 00:20:56,424
You're writing that lightly, but that's serious news.

339
00:20:56,424 --> 00:21:00,093
An emergency occured
while we were playing with the chicken!

340
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:02,238
You fell sick and were hospitalized?

341
00:21:02,238 --> 00:21:04,308
Hermes' finace?

342
00:21:04,971 --> 00:21:06,289
I thought she didn't have a boyfriend.

343
00:21:06,289 --> 00:21:07,856
No, we weren't sure.

344
00:21:07,856 --> 00:21:11,214
Densha, you're not panicking with the recent turn of events?

345
00:21:11,249 --> 00:21:14,002
I was preparing for a bomb, but this is too much.

346
00:21:14,123 --> 00:21:15,246
What kind of guy was this fiance?

347
00:21:15,246 --> 00:21:17,857
Did you talk to Hermes while you were at the hospital?

348
00:21:17,857 --> 00:21:21,402
She came once, but I never got to talk to her.

349
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,741
And the fiance was really good looking.

350
00:21:26,741 --> 00:21:31,850
I was released, but the pain in my heart keeps getting worse.

351
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,557
What's broken here?

352
00:21:41,557 --> 00:21:44,617
Densha, I'm not going to give up.

353
00:21:44,617 --> 00:21:47,617
I'm going to return for you.

354
00:21:47,617 --> 00:21:52,719
Hermes is going to come to understand Densha,
and they'll share a kiss in his arms...

355
00:21:53,551 --> 00:21:55,585
What the- hot, hot!

356
00:21:55,750 --> 00:22:01,797
Densha, as an Otaku your chances of
going out with Hermes were less than 1%.

357
00:22:02,004 --> 00:22:04,415
You knew that and still made it this far.

358
00:22:04,415 --> 00:22:06,398
So what if the fiance is good looking.

359
00:22:06,398 --> 00:22:09,093
Don't get bogged down in something so normal!

360
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:14,209
But he's her fiance.

361
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:17,144
I don't want to bother Hermes-san either.

362
00:22:17,144 --> 00:22:18,896
That's just an excuse to run away.

363
00:22:18,896 --> 00:22:21,221
I can't think Hermes wasn't serious about you.

364
00:22:21,221 --> 00:22:23,087
It's a cunning trap laid by the enemy.

365
00:22:23,087 --> 00:22:24,511
Maybe it was that fake Densha?

366
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:27,302
Then it should be easy.  He seemed really dumb.

367
00:22:27,302 --> 00:22:29,886
I could just be something their parents are interested in.

368
00:22:29,886 --> 00:22:31,052
Who cares about some fiance.

369
00:22:31,052 --> 00:22:33,814
Trust what's in your heart.

370
00:22:43,971 --> 00:22:48,742
I sincerely hoping your relationship
with Hermes works out successfully.

371
00:22:50,421 --> 00:22:55,626
But more importantly,
I want your relationship to be something you're proud of.

372
00:22:56,091 --> 00:22:59,734
Your courage makes the impossible, possible.

373
00:22:59,734 --> 00:23:04,571
I want to believe in your courage.

374
00:23:06,756 --> 00:23:08,475
I don't want you regretting anything.

375
00:23:08,475 --> 00:23:09,678
Talk to Hermes properly.

376
00:23:09,678 --> 00:23:12,865
This isn't the end of the line for you.

377
00:23:12,865 --> 00:23:16,017
Yeah, let's imagine a future where you two are together!

378
00:23:16,017 --> 00:23:19,744
Don't ever give up on your relationship with Hermes.

379
00:23:20,028 --> 00:23:22,955
Work at it like it's the most important thing in your life.

380
00:23:22,955 --> 00:23:25,675
Don't lose to yourself!

381
00:23:28,853 --> 00:23:32,220
Why are you guys so good to me?

382
00:23:33,384 --> 00:23:36,798
Caring so much for a guy like me...

383
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:39,270
I'm so scared.

384
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:42,582
I already running away.

385
00:23:43,349 --> 00:23:46,329
But it's also pathetic.

386
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:52,643
To run away and end it here would be pathetic.

387
00:23:53,334 --> 00:23:54,486
Everyone,

388
00:23:54,486 --> 00:23:56,850
Aren't you upset that Densha's suffering like this!

389
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:59,251
Of course I'm upset!

390
00:23:59,663 --> 00:24:01,735
Everyone!

391
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:06,861
Densha!!

392
00:24:07,461 --> 00:24:09,966
I upset too.

393
00:24:17,584 --> 00:24:18,708
Damn it.

394
00:24:30,605 --> 00:24:32,043
[Aoyama-san]

395
00:24:38,196 --> 00:24:39,921
We're going to block Yamada's calls.

396
00:24:39,921 --> 00:24:41,554
So long, Densha.

397
00:24:41,554 --> 00:24:44,663
I'll make her forget you even existed.

398
00:24:46,565 --> 00:24:47,599
What happened?

399
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:49,950
There was a small bone on it.

400
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:52,174
Hey, why don't we go to the ocean tomorrow.

401
00:24:52,174 --> 00:24:53,463
The ocean?

402
00:24:53,463 --> 00:24:57,858
I thought it would be good for a change of pace.
I haven't surfed in a while either.

403
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,106
Hello?

404
00:25:14,106 --> 00:25:15,623
You've reached the Aoyama residence.

405
00:25:15,623 --> 00:25:17,614
Pleased to make your aquaintance.

406
00:25:17,614 --> 00:25:19,279
I, I, I'm Yamada.

407
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,823
Is S, S, S Saori-san home?

408
00:25:21,823 --> 00:25:23,412
I'm sorry,

409
00:25:23,412 --> 00:25:25,449
but I couldn't quite hear what you said.

410
00:25:25,449 --> 00:25:26,773
Oh, I'm sorry.

411
00:25:26,773 --> 00:25:29,804
Um, this is Yamada calling.

412
00:25:29,804 --> 00:25:31,587
Saori-san is a friend-

413
00:25:31,896 --> 00:25:34,425
or at least on good terms,
well, maybe not, but-

414
00:25:34,537 --> 00:25:38,210
I think she might at least remember me.

415
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:40,802
Oh, you want to reach Saori?

416
00:25:40,802 --> 00:25:42,358
She hasn't come home yet.

417
00:25:42,358 --> 00:25:44,193
I see.

418
00:25:44,193 --> 00:25:47,479
Would you like to leave her a message?

419
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:52,109
What should I do..

420
00:25:53,547 --> 00:25:56,774
Um... Could you ask her,

421
00:25:56,774 --> 00:26:00,855
the reason why she hates me now?

422
00:26:03,403 --> 00:26:07,772
I don't think that's the type of thing you leave as a message.

423
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:11,668
Oh, that's true.  I'm sorry.

424
00:26:11,668 --> 00:26:13,435
So Saori doesn't like you anymore.

425
00:26:13,435 --> 00:26:14,750
Yes.

426
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:17,272
I'm sure she has her reasons...

427
00:26:17,307 --> 00:26:19,048
What are you going to do knowing why?

428
00:26:19,048 --> 00:26:21,325
It could be something you can't do anything about.

429
00:26:21,325 --> 00:26:23,518
I still want to do something.

430
00:26:23,518 --> 00:26:25,470
I want to do everything I can.

431
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,871
I'll change what I can,

432
00:26:26,871 --> 00:26:28,291
Even things I can't I'll do my best to change anyway.

433
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:29,894
So please, could you-

434
00:26:29,894 --> 00:26:32,398
You can plead with me, but I can't do anything.

435
00:26:32,398 --> 00:26:33,785
Huh?

436
00:26:33,785 --> 00:26:35,808
Oh, of course.

437
00:26:35,808 --> 00:26:37,432
I'm sorry.

438
00:26:37,432 --> 00:26:42,546
You didn't by any chance lie to Saori did you?

439
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,439
Lie to her?

440
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:49,000
It could be something so small you didn't even notice.

441
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,143
I did.

442
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:52,327
I told her I had work,

443
00:26:52,327 --> 00:26:54,599
but went out with some guys.

444
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:56,603
That has to be it.

445
00:26:59,097 --> 00:27:02,569
My daughter is really sensitive to lies.

446
00:27:04,024 --> 00:27:05,065
Really?

447
00:27:05,065 --> 00:27:08,224
The reason for it isn't something you need to know about,

448
00:27:08,224 --> 00:27:10,179
but she was traumatized by what happened.

449
00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:12,836
Now she can't trust men.

450
00:27:14,318 --> 00:27:17,969
Is that what it was.

451
00:27:20,924 --> 00:27:21,841
So that means,

452
00:27:21,841 --> 00:27:24,507
it was because you lied about work?

453
00:27:24,507 --> 00:27:26,771
So it wasn't because you were an Otaku.

454
00:27:27,201 --> 00:27:30,635
You had to lose your Otaku anyway.

455
00:27:30,635 --> 00:27:35,553
Actually, I was looking around my room earlier

456
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:38,070
and felt something was missing.

457
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:42,509
I tried, but I can't stop being an Otaku.

458
00:27:44,356 --> 00:27:47,394
But if I hide that I'm an Otaku,

459
00:27:47,394 --> 00:27:49,547
I'll be lying to her.

460
00:27:49,547 --> 00:27:50,838
You're taking it too seriously.

461
00:27:50,838 --> 00:27:52,784
Everyone has things they have to hide.

462
00:27:52,784 --> 00:27:55,516
Quit talking like a wussy, and lose your Otaku again!

463
00:27:55,621 --> 00:27:57,070
There's no need to hide it!

464
00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:00,427
An Otaku is what makes you who you are.

465
00:28:00,427 --> 00:28:03,705
The question isn't whether you're an Otaku.

466
00:28:03,705 --> 00:28:07,000
What's important is trying to be sincere to Hermes.

467
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,910
Trying to lose your otaku shows your sincerity.

468
00:28:10,024 --> 00:28:14,111
No it isn't. It's telling her that he's an Otaku.

469
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,915
Is there any hope doing that?

470
00:28:15,915 --> 00:28:19,704
I couldn't do it, but you shouldn't be ashamed of your Otaku.

471
00:28:20,746 --> 00:28:25,329
Hermes doesn't care whether you're an Otaku or not.

472
00:28:25,364 --> 00:28:27,865
So you shouldn't press the issue.

473
00:28:27,865 --> 00:28:29,421
"I, I'm an Otaku."

474
00:28:29,421 --> 00:28:31,768
That'll get you rejected for sure.

475
00:28:31,768 --> 00:28:34,411
Even Hermes will hate you if you're an Otaku.

476
00:28:34,411 --> 00:28:38,954
It doesn't matter.  Show her the true spirit of an Otaku.

477
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:44,309
Everyone, thanks for all your replies.

478
00:28:44,309 --> 00:28:47,422
I know it's a crazy gamble,

479
00:28:47,422 --> 00:28:52,475
but I can't lie to her anymore.

480
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:14,278
I'm going to come out to Hermes about my Otaku.

481
00:29:17,007 --> 00:29:18,532
Densha, bravo!

482
00:29:18,532 --> 00:29:20,498
I can't be responsible for what happens.

483
00:29:20,498 --> 00:29:22,378
Kudos for a Densha-like decision.

484
00:29:22,378 --> 00:29:23,733
You fool.

485
00:29:23,768 --> 00:29:25,894
That's the Densha I love!

486
00:29:25,894 --> 00:29:28,277
Get ready for war and prepare bamboo spears!

487
00:29:28,277 --> 00:29:29,474
Bamboo?

488
00:29:29,474 --> 00:29:30,481
What are you going to do with that?

489
00:29:30,481 --> 00:29:33,415
Us men are getting ready to rock!

490
00:29:33,529 --> 00:29:36,145
Head off into the sunset you suicide bomber!

491
00:29:36,145 --> 00:29:38,042
Don't worry, we'll be here to pick up the pieces.

492
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,949
Please, Hermes.  Don't betray Densha.

493
00:29:39,949 --> 00:29:43,543
No matter what happens, come back proud.

494
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:58,858
All right.

495
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:00,317
Yamada-shi,

496
00:30:00,317 --> 00:30:02,123
I was waiting for you to say that.

497
00:30:02,123 --> 00:30:04,524
Thank you.

498
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:07,534
So I was wondering...

499
00:30:07,534 --> 00:30:08,944
Um.

500
00:30:08,944 --> 00:30:11,229
Those figures I gave you..

501
00:30:11,229 --> 00:30:13,229
could I have them back?

502
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:20,635
Certificate of Non-Otakuness returned.

503
00:30:20,635 --> 00:30:21,680
I was waiting for this.

504
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,636
Thank you so much.

505
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:25,538
Matsunaga-shi,

506
00:30:25,538 --> 00:30:30,400
return it.

507
00:30:31,714 --> 00:30:34,590
Huh?  It's light.

508
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,004
What's this?

509
00:30:50,438 --> 00:30:52,480
I wonder what it could be.

510
00:30:58,885 --> 00:31:00,061
Was it like this?

511
00:31:00,061 --> 00:31:02,701
Yeah, that's the way it was.

512
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,691
So there was something there!

513
00:31:09,691 --> 00:31:11,572
Not Soma Megumi...

514
00:31:11,572 --> 00:31:12,887
Soma Megumi!

515
00:31:13,548 --> 00:31:15,618
[Yamada Tsuyoshi]

516
00:31:17,332 --> 00:31:19,682
So instead of just letting it ruin your relationships,

517
00:31:19,682 --> 00:31:23,478
shouldn't you be trying to get over it?

518
00:31:23,889 --> 00:31:26,107
Saori can I have a minute?

519
00:31:26,107 --> 00:31:28,697
Sorry, but I have to go to the ocean.

520
00:31:28,697 --> 00:31:30,386
I have to talk to you about your Father.

521
00:31:30,386 --> 00:31:33,015
Have a seat.

522
00:31:36,722 --> 00:31:39,616
Your Father's coming back to Japan.

523
00:31:41,371 --> 00:31:44,234
We'll probably officially divorse then.

524
00:31:44,234 --> 00:31:45,648
Really?

525
00:31:46,758 --> 00:31:47,763
Hey,

526
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:53,593
The reason why you can't trust men.

527
00:31:54,826 --> 00:31:56,737
Was it us?

528
00:31:58,946 --> 00:32:01,704
No, that had nothing to do with it.

529
00:32:02,214 --> 00:32:04,612
Ok, that's all.

530
00:32:06,112 --> 00:32:07,448
I'll be going then.

531
00:32:09,651 --> 00:32:13,315
There's not a man in the world who doesn't lie.

532
00:32:13,315 --> 00:32:17,055
But lying doesn't necessarily mean betrayal.

533
00:32:17,055 --> 00:32:22,083
I think it's ok forgive a lie told to you
by someone who really cares about you.

534
00:32:23,355 --> 00:32:27,254
I couldn't forgive your Father's lie.

535
00:32:28,699 --> 00:32:30,480
And so...

536
00:32:32,556 --> 00:32:36,005
Take care now.

537
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:04,398
Welcome back.

538
00:33:24,388 --> 00:33:27,255
3 more minutes to go.

539
00:33:33,767 --> 00:33:37,713
The next request is from Sakurai Kazuya,
to Saori with love.

540
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:39,187
Fantasy.

541
00:33:40,135 --> 00:33:43,366
Sometimes you can't see what's right in front of you.

542
00:33:43,366 --> 00:33:45,911
I'm sorry I didn't see how beautiful you were.

543
00:33:45,911 --> 00:33:47,193
What?

544
00:33:48,511 --> 00:33:51,434
Like that lighthouse there,

545
00:33:51,434 --> 00:33:54,845
I want to watch over you forever.

546
00:34:06,526 --> 00:34:08,214
Let's get married.

547
00:34:11,096 --> 00:34:12,701
Yes.

548
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:21,024
It's perfect.

549
00:34:21,928 --> 00:34:23,008
Quit wimping out.

550
00:34:23,371 --> 00:34:24,386
Sis, it's heavy.

551
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,022
Hold it properly!

552
00:34:37,612 --> 00:34:38,487
Hello?

553
00:34:39,001 --> 00:34:41,077
Sorry to bother you during a date.

554
00:34:41,146 --> 00:34:42,120
Keisuke?

555
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,530
I got a call from Yamada just now.

556
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:46,860
He's been trying to reach you on your cell,

557
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,307
but couldn't get through.

558
00:34:49,307 --> 00:34:51,595
He says there's something he just has to tell you.

559
00:34:51,595 --> 00:34:52,627
Got it.

560
00:34:52,627 --> 00:34:54,139
Thanks.

561
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:55,932
Later.

562
00:35:01,317 --> 00:35:02,695
I...

563
00:35:02,695 --> 00:35:05,350
was lying to you.

564
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:07,195
That's why,

565
00:35:07,195 --> 00:35:09,350
it's not a lie.

566
00:35:12,307 --> 00:35:17,304
I think it's ok forgive a lie told to you
by someone who really cares about you.

567
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:26,900
Hm? What happened?

568
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,772
I'm sorry.  There's somewhere I have to go.

569
00:35:29,772 --> 00:35:32,825
To Densh- Yamada's place?

570
00:35:34,284 --> 00:35:35,933
Wait a minute!

571
00:35:39,141 --> 00:35:41,470
Sometimes you can't see what's right in front of you.

572
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:46,399
I'm sorry I didn't see how beautiful you were.

573
00:35:46,399 --> 00:35:48,359
Like that lighthouse there,

574
00:35:48,394 --> 00:35:50,741
I want to watch over you forever.

575
00:35:51,611 --> 00:35:54,324
Hey, hey, what're doing with my Evo?

576
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,956
This is serious!

577
00:35:56,999 --> 00:35:57,916
Oh, the ring.

578
00:35:58,687 --> 00:36:01,096
Argh!  No way!

579
00:36:01,096 --> 00:36:02,287
My Evo!

580
00:36:02,287 --> 00:36:03,544
Saori!

581
00:36:03,544 --> 00:36:05,239
Ring!

582
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:07,000
Come back!

583
00:36:30,562 --> 00:36:34,736
That was the 25th busy call.

584
00:36:37,916 --> 00:36:40,922
Is this really the end?

585
00:36:48,282 --> 00:36:48,844
It's hot?

586
00:36:49,202 --> 00:36:50,538
Yeah, it's hot.

587
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,637
Who is-

588
00:36:55,843 --> 00:36:56,732
It's a dream.

589
00:36:56,732 --> 00:36:58,522
It's gotta be a dream.

590
00:37:05,138 --> 00:37:07,020
It's not a dream.

591
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:09,842
W, what should I do?

592
00:37:09,842 --> 00:37:11,891
First some proper clothes-

593
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:16,750
That's right.

594
00:37:22,068 --> 00:37:23,212
Ok.

595
00:37:27,107 --> 00:37:29,748
I'm sorry for visiting you so suddenly.

596
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,043
It's ok.

597
00:37:31,043 --> 00:37:33,027
I couldn't reach you on the phone,

598
00:37:33,027 --> 00:37:35,732
so I thought I would never see you again.

599
00:37:35,732 --> 00:37:38,596
I got a call from Keisuke.

600
00:37:38,596 --> 00:37:40,186
I see.

601
00:37:40,186 --> 00:37:43,279
You said you had something to tell me?

602
00:37:44,426 --> 00:37:45,798
Yes.

603
00:37:48,481 --> 00:37:50,004
This one's salty.

604
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,957
No it isn't.

605
00:37:51,986 --> 00:37:53,953
Here, try this.

606
00:37:53,953 --> 00:37:55,961
Pleased to meet you.

607
00:37:57,654 --> 00:37:59,571
This way.

608
00:38:00,538 --> 00:38:02,138
Your mother's become younger.

609
00:38:02,138 --> 00:38:03,543
What do you mean?

610
00:38:03,543 --> 00:38:05,490
That doesn't happen.

611
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:08,415
I'm sorry, but I'm almost ready.

612
00:38:08,551 --> 00:38:10,385
Ok.

613
00:38:14,661 --> 00:38:15,880
Please,

614
00:38:16,387 --> 00:38:18,644
come in.

615
00:38:49,172 --> 00:38:55,399
It was during highschool that I started watching anime.

616
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,821
Then...

617
00:38:59,821 --> 00:39:03,844
I started collecting games and figures.

618
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:12,934
During college, I started going to Akihabara.

619
00:39:15,241 --> 00:39:19,558
And I started going to events featuring voice actresses.

620
00:39:20,308 --> 00:39:24,252
And to get hold of limited edition posters,

621
00:39:24,253 --> 00:39:28,343
I'd stay up for 3 days straight.

622
00:39:30,375 --> 00:39:33,715
Instead of talking to people,

623
00:39:34,991 --> 00:39:42,778
I liked playing games and watching anime by myself more.

624
00:39:45,729 --> 00:39:54,355
And so I started being called an Otaku from people around me.

625
00:39:59,349 --> 00:40:00,757
But...

626
00:40:02,057 --> 00:40:08,291
Because I still loved games and anime,

627
00:40:10,696 --> 00:40:13,151
I couldn't stop.

628
00:40:15,669 --> 00:40:22,272
That's the kind of guy I am.

629
00:40:26,544 --> 00:40:30,568
I'm...

630
00:40:30,568 --> 00:40:34,075
an Otaku.

631
00:40:36,238 --> 00:40:38,853
If I'm called lame,

632
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,623
or gross,

633
00:40:40,623 --> 00:40:44,051
They have every reason for it.

634
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:49,138
But,

635
00:40:51,579 --> 00:40:57,513
I can't live any other way.

636
00:41:02,157 --> 00:41:06,466
I don't want to lie to you anymore.

637
00:41:09,541 --> 00:41:11,505
So...

638
00:41:12,044 --> 00:41:17,564
even though I'm really embarrassed,

639
00:41:18,479 --> 00:41:23,363
I wanted you to see me as I am.

640
00:41:31,137 --> 00:41:35,940
If you don't mind that it's me,

641
00:41:38,739 --> 00:41:41,539
can we be friends again?

642
00:41:51,524 --> 00:41:52,580
Yamada-san.

643
00:41:57,756 --> 00:41:59,788
That's not fair.

644
00:42:02,084 --> 00:42:06,641
You said what I wanted to say before I could.

645
00:42:07,916 --> 00:42:09,782
Really?

646
00:42:15,628 --> 00:42:18,360
I think it's a wonderful room.

647
00:42:20,862 --> 00:42:22,818
It's very unique.

648
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:28,768
I like it.

649
00:42:37,302 --> 00:42:43,282
Would you make up with me?

650
00:42:46,678 --> 00:42:48,432
Yes.

651
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:58,712
YES!!

652
00:43:26,667 --> 00:43:29,741
[Thank you for your courage]

653
00:43:33,605 --> 00:43:35,321
That's awesome!!  Awesome!!  Densha!!

654
00:43:35,356 --> 00:43:37,005
I'm proud of you, you're the best.

655
00:43:38,016 --> 00:43:39,368
I'm crying and I can't stop.

656
00:43:46,569 --> 00:43:47,845
[Aoyama-san]

657
00:43:50,769 --> 00:43:51,855
Yes?

658
00:43:51,855 --> 00:43:54,824
Thank you for the birthday present.

659
00:43:54,935 --> 00:43:56,839
Not at all.

660
00:43:56,839 --> 00:44:00,938
You really don't mind getting something like that?

661
00:44:01,296 --> 00:44:03,778
It's really cute.

662
00:44:03,778 --> 00:44:06,648
I've already set it up in my room.

663
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,969
Really?
