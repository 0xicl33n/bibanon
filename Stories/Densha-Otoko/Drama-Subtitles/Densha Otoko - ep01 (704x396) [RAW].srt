1
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:10,047
Yes!

2
00:02:29,718 --> 00:02:31,383
Two Days Ago

3
00:02:31,798 --> 00:02:36,934
With this, you'll instantly be a better chef,
and your husband will want to come home early.

4
00:02:37,063 --> 00:02:37,878
Look closely;

5
00:02:38,523 --> 00:02:40,102
dicing onions, slicing onions,

6
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,785
it's great for your health and you'll look fabulous.

7
00:02:43,448 --> 00:02:46,527
In 3 days you'll look like Cleopatra, in a week, like Kiyokawa Nigiko.

8
00:02:47,526 --> 00:02:49,203
You can really keep your family healthy with this.

9
00:02:49,634 --> 00:02:50,528
You, young lad!

10
00:02:51,163 --> 00:02:54,116
Yes you, the one looking all lonely.

11
00:02:55,267 --> 00:02:58,897
This is also perfect for someone unhealthy looking like you.
Here, take a look.

12
00:02:59,573 --> 00:03:02,075
Come on, just for a bit.  Take a look!

13
00:03:02,678 --> 00:03:05,397
Here we go, just take a look at that cutting action!

14
00:03:05,846 --> 00:03:09,794
With this slicer you can make all the difficult cuts
that the professionals can.

15
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:11,682
Just look at the smoothness of that surface!

16
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,466
Look at that!

17
00:03:13,623 --> 00:03:16,102
This can be had for just 3800 yen, can you believe it?

18
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,258
There just isn't another kitchen implement that can do so much.

19
00:03:18,393 --> 00:03:21,639
Now all you need to do is buy it and see the results for yourself.
How about it?

20
00:03:22,264 --> 00:03:23,264
It's amazing.

21
00:03:23,265 --> 00:03:25,014
But...

22
00:03:25,027 --> 00:03:25,948
But?

23
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,095
I'm not sure I'll use it.

24
00:03:28,189 --> 00:03:30,793
Then give it to your parents.  They'll love it.

25
00:03:31,323 --> 00:03:34,830
But I need the money for games....

26
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:38,648
Your body's become weak playing too many games,
and you're shaming your family.

27
00:03:38,411 --> 00:03:41,699
Whether you change is up to you.  What do you say?

28
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:47,357
(Buy it, buy it.  You should buy it.
Your family will be happy.  Buy it.)

29
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:49,752
Yaman, you vile creature plagueing our world,

30
00:03:50,665 --> 00:03:52,266
let me give you some of my treatment!

31
00:03:54,621 --> 00:03:55,629
Mina-Kick!

32
00:03:57,749 --> 00:03:58,418
Did you see that!

33
00:03:58,917 --> 00:04:00,596
Matsunaga-san, you're drooling man.

34
00:04:00,853 --> 00:04:03,074
Episode 17, and we finally get to see Mina's punch.

35
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:04,916
And that exquisite glimpse of her panties.

36
00:04:04,951 --> 00:04:08,373
I'm loosing faith in the production staff myself;
they've reached their limits.

37
00:04:08,637 --> 00:04:09,868
I hope I've got it all properly recorded at home.

38
00:04:10,182 --> 00:04:12,332
Matsunaga, you shouldn't be so into
a production with such mediocre levels.

39
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:13,909
None of my friends think that, Kawamoto-shi!

40
00:04:14,027 --> 00:04:15,380
And that just makes it worse.

41
00:04:16,753 --> 00:04:18,888
Sorry I'm late.

42
00:04:19,152 --> 00:04:20,696
Yamada-shi, you're late.  What happened?

43
00:04:20,753 --> 00:04:22,040
I got sidetracked.

44
00:04:22,417 --> 00:04:25,169
So what kind of evils did we give into today?

45
00:04:25,504 --> 00:04:28,560
A slicer, one of new electric shavers,

46
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,384
and also some animation software.

47
00:04:32,969 --> 00:04:33,752
Uhh, and...

48
00:04:35,391 --> 00:04:36,135
this is...

49
00:04:45,856 --> 00:04:49,856
Our chairman's amazing isn't he?
Usually a company party-

50
00:04:49,972 --> 00:04:51,397
He just wants to show off a little.

51
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,090
It looks like everyone's trying to show off today!

52
00:04:54,265 --> 00:04:56,449
You're pretty dressed up yourself, Yuuko.

53
00:04:56,753 --> 00:04:58,617
Do you really think so?  I didn't realize!

54
00:04:58,598 --> 00:04:59,001
Hey.

55
00:04:59,602 --> 00:05:00,796
Just because you're young doesn't-

56
00:05:00,797 --> 00:05:01,797
Oh my gosh.

57
00:05:01,798 --> 00:05:02,798
What, where?

58
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:03,799
There.

59
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,092
Ok, I'm going to show you what it means to be experienced.
You just watch.

60
00:05:08,794 --> 00:05:09,491
Where's Saori?

61
00:05:09,523 --> 00:05:11,624
Probably drawing the attention of men all around her.

62
00:05:13,608 --> 00:05:15,814
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry!

63
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:17,154
That's stale.

64
00:05:48,611 --> 00:05:53,156
So Karin, what do you wear when you go to sleep?

65
00:05:53,391 --> 00:05:57,213
Umm...I sleep at night in a pajama.

66
00:05:57,214 --> 00:05:59,757
A pajama!  Ok, and what color is this pajama?

67
00:06:00,052 --> 00:06:02,011
I've recently bought a pink one.

68
00:06:02,565 --> 00:06:06,213
Pink. Just imagine it folks, pink!

69
00:06:06,772 --> 00:06:08,059
Hey, what are you doing?

70
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:09,818
I'm copying every word, like it says in the magazines.

71
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:11,919
And where do you wash yourself first in a bath?

72
00:06:12,564 --> 00:06:13,534
Come on, tell us.

73
00:06:14,565 --> 00:06:16,193
I wash my neck first.

74
00:06:16,693 --> 00:06:17,572
What are you doing?

75
00:06:17,782 --> 00:06:20,860
If I'm going to be listening to Mina's voice,
then I have to be looking at her too.

76
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:22,179
Right?

77
00:06:23,498 --> 00:06:28,345
Ok folks, this is what you've been waiting for, picture time!!

78
00:06:34,396 --> 00:06:38,063
From when I say so, you have 1 minute.

79
00:06:38,135 --> 00:06:39,958
Start!!

80
00:06:39,964 --> 00:06:41,043
Look here, look here!

81
00:06:42,092 --> 00:06:45,481
Karin's smile, you have 1 minute to capture her smile.

82
00:06:47,917 --> 00:06:49,101
Your ankles, show me your ankles!

83
00:06:53,761 --> 00:06:55,083
Mina, let me see your ankles.

84
00:06:56,234 --> 00:06:57,042
More of your ankles.  Please.

85
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,168
Sir, you have to be seated, stay seated.

86
00:06:59,681 --> 00:07:00,584
I'm properly seated.  See look.

87
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:01,473
Just barely!

88
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,385
Your ankles.

89
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,444
Let's capture that smile.

90
00:07:13,012 --> 00:07:14,059
What is it?

91
00:07:14,762 --> 00:07:15,835
Why is it you're smiling so much?

92
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:17,597
Maybe you knew I was there.

93
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:23,496
Nope.  I was thinking about when Prince and Princess
will meet again in the Milkyway.

94
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:26,729
You're so naturally pretty, it's cute.

95
00:07:31,053 --> 00:07:34,236
A one minute photography session.  They're so mean.

96
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,291
Yeah, I wanted at least a minute and a half.

97
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:39,002
Does 30 seconds make a difference?

98
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:43,272
It's totally different; with a minute and a half
your subject will look at you twice.

99
00:07:43,667 --> 00:07:45,268
That way you can get the pose that you want.

100
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:47,449
Now I get it.

101
00:07:48,164 --> 00:07:51,709
Gentlemen, would you like to write your wishes for this year?

102
00:07:56,863 --> 00:07:59,495
Oh yeah, it's almost...

103
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,798
time for Tanabata.

104
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:07,558
So that at least some of your wishes may come true,

105
00:08:08,648 --> 00:08:12,104
I pledge to work ever harder to meet your needs.

106
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,829
What is it?

107
00:08:14,014 --> 00:08:15,655
I don't know what Tanabata is.

108
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:22,220
It's about these two lovers,
Princess Orihime and Prince Hikoboshi who

109
00:08:22,754 --> 00:08:25,976
insult and beat up each other,
then use robots to try to end it.

110
00:08:26,695 --> 00:08:27,730
But deep in their hearts

111
00:08:28,272 --> 00:08:32,608
they really loved each other.
That why each year,

112
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:39,593
they meet in the Milkyway, and go crazy trying to kill each other.
It's total murderous madness in the heavens!

113
00:08:40,151 --> 00:08:44,072
In the end they throw tons of modified super missile
punches at each other.  And then it ends.

114
00:08:44,468 --> 00:08:45,707
It's a nice story.

115
00:08:46,028 --> 00:08:46,716
Isn't it?

116
00:08:47,051 --> 00:08:51,298
And now, I'd like to give you all
a present to express my gratitude.

117
00:08:51,892 --> 00:08:54,147
Please join me now on the deck.

118
00:08:56,972 --> 00:08:59,814
So what are you wishing for this year?

119
00:09:00,605 --> 00:09:04,022
Me?  Let's see...

120
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,233
Probably...

121
00:09:09,818 --> 00:09:12,498
Mina in a movie.  What else is there?

122
00:09:12,794 --> 00:09:15,076
There's no way that's happening.
Wish for something realistic.

123
00:09:15,335 --> 00:09:16,579
And you?  What do you want Kawamoto-shi?

124
00:09:17,982 --> 00:09:19,012
Another season of Mina.

125
00:09:19,368 --> 00:09:20,159
So you DO like Mina!

126
00:09:21,178 --> 00:09:24,364
Well personally I think...that is to say...

127
00:09:24,187 --> 00:09:26,084
So how about you, Yamada, what are you wishing for?

128
00:09:26,437 --> 00:09:27,413
For me...

129
00:09:28,327 --> 00:09:30,115
I'd like to get transfered to a different division at work.

130
00:09:30,548 --> 00:09:32,441
That's not the type of thing you're supposed to wish for.

131
00:09:33,353 --> 00:09:34,873
That's true.

132
00:09:35,766 --> 00:09:40,835
So ladies and gentlemen,
if you could all join me in the countdown.

133
00:09:41,834 --> 00:09:42,292
_10_

134
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:43,819
_9_

135
00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:45,446
_8_

00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:46,857
_7_

00:09:47,856 --> 00:09:48,208
_6_

138
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,841
It's a serious issue for me.

139
00:09:52,796 --> 00:09:56,475
To continue working in sales when I'm no good at it.

140
00:09:57,238 --> 00:09:57,678
_3_

141
00:09:58,758 --> 00:09:59,109
_2_

142
00:10:00,228 --> 00:10:00,577
_1_

143
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,711
It really feels like summer.

144
00:10:24,638 --> 00:10:26,870
Of course it does, it's already July.

145
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,670
The Train Man

146
00:12:30,261 --> 00:12:32,437
I mostly get excited about ankles.

147
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:35,122
Just imagining Mina's ankles I-

148
00:12:35,265 --> 00:12:38,801
Please don't.  I only think about Mina for one thing.

149
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,589
Yeah, that face and at her age,
she's a gift from the gods.

150
00:12:42,398 --> 00:12:43,311
And Yamada-shi, what about you?

151
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:45,414
I'm...

152
00:12:46,077 --> 00:12:48,327
a fan of her soft full lips.

153
00:13:09,683 --> 00:13:12,097
Did you see yesterday's Robot Wars?

154
00:13:12,298 --> 00:13:14,659
Of course.  With that scene
with Corporal Tsubaki in the cockpit.

155
00:13:15,577 --> 00:13:17,618
Me too, I loved that scene.

156
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:30,700
See you tomorrow then.

157
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:31,731
Ok, good night.

158
00:13:32,195 --> 00:13:32,580
Good night.

159
00:13:34,892 --> 00:13:37,490
[There will be a short wait until the
next train departs due to a change in schedule]

160
00:13:54,618 --> 00:13:55,937
You can leave my stuff alone.

161
00:13:56,307 --> 00:13:56,873
But-

162
00:13:57,314 --> 00:13:58,052
I said, don't touch anything!

163
00:13:58,574 --> 00:13:58,958
Ok.

164
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,976
Um, um.

165
00:14:13,182 --> 00:14:13,771
What!

166
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,902
This brush, it's yours isn't it?

167
00:14:25,418 --> 00:14:25,859
Please.

168
00:15:22,586 --> 00:15:23,918
Yes...

169
00:15:37,746 --> 00:15:39,946
That woman in front of us, do you think she's a model?

170
00:15:40,793 --> 00:15:43,185
I thought so too.  She's so pretty.

171
00:15:43,186 --> 00:15:45,987
Isn't she?  She's georgous.

172
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,917
Hehe.  Old man, old man.

173
00:16:45,966 --> 00:16:48,117
You've got a middle aged stink, you stupid.

174
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,716
Bastards gotta make these doors automatic.

175
00:16:57,457 --> 00:17:03,575
Why is it in the summer, they won't put eggs on
beef bowls when you're taking out?

176
00:17:04,105 --> 00:17:05,545
They should give us a discount.

177
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,814
You, what are you doing ringing that phone for?

178
00:17:14,731 --> 00:17:15,571
I wasn't-

179
00:17:15,975 --> 00:17:17,453
Don't talk back at me you punk!

180
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,078
Now tell me where Japan's fastest roller coaster is!

181
00:17:22,947 --> 00:17:23,628
I don't know, I don't know.

182
00:17:24,362 --> 00:17:28,346
You don't know?  It's Fuji Q's Keroppa. The Keroppa, you hear?

183
00:17:28,594 --> 00:17:29,620
It's Udonppa you idiot.  Hehehe.

184
00:17:30,273 --> 00:17:32,982
What, who was that laughing over there?

185
00:17:34,023 --> 00:17:36,864
You there, was it you?

186
00:17:39,054 --> 00:17:43,812
Smokers like me are hated now.
Do you know what it's like?

187
00:17:44,212 --> 00:17:45,309
Do you?

188
00:17:45,527 --> 00:17:47,074
I'm getting angry here!

189
00:17:47,655 --> 00:17:51,855
It might be wrong, but, but I'm going to have me a smoke.

190
00:17:53,078 --> 00:17:55,784
And you know what? I'm going to finish smoking this too.

191
00:17:56,643 --> 00:17:58,961
Absolutely terrible.
If only someone-

192
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:05,062
What was that?
The bunch of you were insulting me weren't you?

193
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,397
We didn't say anything-

194
00:18:06,829 --> 00:18:07,332
Shudup!

195
00:18:07,969 --> 00:18:13,368
Now that they have dryers with washing machines,
you women think you can play around all day huh?

196
00:18:15,558 --> 00:18:18,949
Buying your way out everything!
The world doesn't work that way!

197
00:18:24,474 --> 00:18:25,251
Hey girl.

198
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,996
You're a real pretty one aincha?

199
00:18:33,634 --> 00:18:39,608
Hey. So how about petting my little guy here.
Yeah, pet it.

200
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:46,454
If you don't want to give it a rub here,
we can go to a nice massage parlour together.

201
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,352
How about it?  You don't mind do you?

202
00:18:50,316 --> 00:18:52,498
Come on, baby, come on.

203
00:18:54,118 --> 00:18:55,380
Stop it, please.

204
00:18:56,439 --> 00:19:00,368
Stop it?  I haven't done anything yet.

205
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:06,008
I know what it is; you probably think
my thing's small don't you?

206
00:19:06,596 --> 00:19:10,852
I can't have you thinking that.  I might be short,
but my bad boy's bigger than you'd think.

207
00:19:12,142 --> 00:19:13,924
Let me show you.  Here, take a look.

208
00:19:19,231 --> 00:19:20,161
Stop it!

209
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:21,303
Say what?

210
00:19:28,188 --> 00:19:28,612
What is it?

211
00:19:29,266 --> 00:19:32,705
Ssstop it.  I'm telling you to stop.

212
00:19:35,649 --> 00:19:37,456
What d'ya think you're trying to do kid?

213
00:19:37,758 --> 00:19:41,151
Can't you tell she doesn't like what you're doing?

214
00:19:41,186 --> 00:19:47,204
What the &*%$!  You think you think-
How old you think you are eh?

215
00:19:59,649 --> 00:20:04,814
Bastard...  Just 'cause you're young,
don't think you can-  Ow, ow, ow...

216
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:08,144
It's a shame acting like this as an adult.

217
00:20:08,884 --> 00:20:10,508
Let me go, darn it!  Let me go!

218
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:17,826
Ow, ow.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.
I just got a bit drunk, that's all.

219
00:20:17,761 --> 00:20:19,320
Is this the person who was causing the trouble?

220
00:20:19,471 --> 00:20:19,901
Yes.

221
00:20:20,527 --> 00:20:21,430
Ok, let's go.

222
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:26,670
I can walk by myself. Leave me alone.

223
00:20:28,613 --> 00:20:29,789
You've really drunk too much.

224
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:33,669
Are you alright?

225
00:20:35,685 --> 00:20:36,286
You've got a nosebleed.

226
00:20:49,051 --> 00:20:50,028
That Sariman was so cool.

227
00:20:52,158 --> 00:20:53,941
And I look so lame.

228
00:20:56,757 --> 00:21:02,061
And then he came our way.  You wouldn't believe it.
He was all dryer this, petting that. Oh my...

229
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,431
The things certain people say...

230
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:11,711
Thank you so much for your help.

231
00:21:11,547 --> 00:21:12,557
Not at all.

232
00:21:13,282 --> 00:21:16,673
I was wondering.  Wouldn't you give me your address?
I'd like to thank you somehow.

233
00:21:17,036 --> 00:21:18,958
It's really ok, I couldn't.

234
00:21:19,224 --> 00:21:20,587
It'll make me feel better.  Here, you can write it in this.

235
00:21:27,935 --> 00:21:32,156
Umm.  Would you mind giving me your address too?

236
00:21:34,174 --> 00:21:34,695
Please?

237
00:21:36,015 --> 00:21:37,183
Yes, ok.

238
00:21:38,955 --> 00:21:39,459
Sorry.

239
00:21:40,076 --> 00:21:40,521
It's ok.

240
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,558
You can see that lame otaku-fashion
coming from 100 meters off.

241
00:22:04,137 --> 00:22:04,641
Stop dressing like that.

242
00:22:06,071 --> 00:22:07,709
You're disturbing the neighborhood just being here.

243
00:22:14,315 --> 00:22:15,299
He's SO irritating.

244
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:22,845
Use this.

245
00:22:23,237 --> 00:22:23,897
Really?

246
00:22:26,123 --> 00:22:29,276
Oh, Mother's at a reunion, and is going to be late.

247
00:22:30,699 --> 00:22:33,243
Huh? Something about that boy is so irritating.

248
00:22:54,536 --> 00:22:58,486
I got asked my address.  Hehe.

249
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,413
"Rant thread for single men"

250
00:23:06,962 --> 00:23:14,677
Hello.  I've always just lurked on this forum,
but today I have some news to tell you about.

251
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:22,125
I was at an anime event in Akihabara today,
and on the way back home an old drunk started
harrassing the other passengers on the train.

252
00:23:23,409 --> 00:23:24,220
Send

253
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:38,775
It was looking pretty ugly,
so I worked up the courage and yelled "Stop it".

254
00:23:39,405 --> 00:23:43,763
My voice was probably shaking.
I'd never been in a fight before.

255
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:54,812
In the end, this sarariman came and helped me.
That riman was so cool, and I looked so lame.

256
00:24:00,275 --> 00:24:05,635
After that, I had to go to the police to write my statement.

257
00:24:13,231 --> 00:24:17,087
After the older lady asked me for my address,
the younger one asked me too.

258
00:24:17,613 --> 00:24:25,761
I totally panicked.  Even before the drunk came,
I'd noticed how pretty she was.

259
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:31,036
Hey!  Come on out!  If you don't come out,
I'm adding some more bruises!

260
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:40,356
I realized it later, but I wonder why I didn't
get her contact info from her.

261
00:24:41,004 --> 00:24:45,978
It was the first time I'd ever been thanked
by a girl.  I was so nervous.

262
00:24:48,883 --> 00:24:53,311
If you gave her your address, she'll send you a present.
That's what I think.

263
00:25:03,176 --> 00:25:09,721
It was brave of you to stand up against a drunk.
Good job.

264
00:25:10,088 --> 00:25:13,019
So you got on some girl's address book, big deal.

265
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:15,214
What where the specs on the young one?

266
00:25:18,029 --> 00:25:26,482
Probably around 25.  She seemed older than me.
Longish dark hair, and she had a slender body.

267
00:25:27,547 --> 00:25:30,903
Her skin was fair, and she was so sweet and pretty looking.

268
00:25:31,713 --> 00:25:35,744
I'm jealous that you even able to talk to a girl like that.

269
00:25:36,139 --> 00:25:37,532
She lives in a different world from ours.

270
00:25:38,173 --> 00:25:40,108
I'd say it's hopeless.

271
00:25:40,515 --> 00:25:42,234
For my sake, I'm hoping this'll have a boring end.

272
00:25:42,503 --> 00:25:44,247
I'm interested in what happens after this.

273
00:25:44,596 --> 00:25:46,517
She'll forget all about any gifts by tomorrow.

274
00:25:46,791 --> 00:25:49,492
An applause for our brave member.
I await further developments.

275
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:51,139
Olay, olay!

276
00:25:51,522 --> 00:25:55,769
The older lady was probably just asking for your
address out of courtesy.  I wouldn't expect much.

277
00:25:58,683 --> 00:26:01,261
I gift.  Oh man...

278
00:26:04,463 --> 00:26:08,522
No way, no way.  It's not going to happen.
I can't get my hopes up.

279
00:26:13,794 --> 00:26:16,018
Uhh, I didn't get a wink of sleep last night.

280
00:26:16,358 --> 00:26:27,548
We'll be making stops at: Tsudanuma, Funabashi,
Ichikawa, Shinkoiwa, Kinnshicho, Bakurocho, Shinnihonbashi,
and Tokyo.  Right, clear, Left clear-Hey!

281
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:31,435
You're late!  What were you doing?

282
00:26:32,413 --> 00:26:33,844
This door doesn't open.

283
00:26:36,703 --> 00:26:39,237
This door can't be openned using the key for the jail.

284
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:44,305
You have to look for a golden key in the tower of light.
I suggest you go back and look for it.

285
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,161
Inagi, Tsudanuma, Funabashi, Ichikawa...

286
00:26:56,435 --> 00:26:57,811
Saori!

287
00:26:58,371 --> 00:26:59,635
Morning.
Good Morning.

288
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:04,647
Yesterday I saw this really weird dream.
You were in it, and you were singing.
No way!  Really.

289
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:39,094
We're a placement agency here.
What are you doing if you can't get our people jobs?!

290
00:27:39,781 --> 00:27:42,525
Yamada!

291
00:27:44,984 --> 00:27:47,408
You're looking tired,
but did you spend all night looking for campanies?

292
00:27:48,117 --> 00:27:49,507
Care to tell us your results?

293
00:27:49,848 --> 00:27:53,192
There were no new companies last week.

294
00:27:53,398 --> 00:27:58,692
Then all you're doing is maintaining the single contract
the guy before you got!

295
00:27:59,564 --> 00:28:00,125
I'm sorry sir.

296
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:05,403
What are you doing at our meeting then?
Get out there and find us some clients.

297
00:28:05,916 --> 00:28:06,398
Right now?

298
00:28:06,692 --> 00:28:07,155
Now.

299
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,437
Yes, yes sir.

300
00:28:08,852 --> 00:28:09,731
Ok, next Tanaka.

301
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:13,083
I got two placements at Shakai Shuuji
in the system development division.

302
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:16,387
Marveleous Tanaka,  marvelous.  I'll give you a kiss later.

303
00:28:18,081 --> 00:28:20,546
Hmm.  This so good.

304
00:28:20,752 --> 00:28:24,845
Oh that's right.  Saori, I need you to come
with me later to buy a new powder brush.

305
00:28:25,188 --> 00:28:25,619
Sure.

306
00:28:26,595 --> 00:28:29,295
You wouldn't believe this one annoying guy I met yesteday.

307
00:28:36,937 --> 00:28:40,143
But did you have to throw it out right in front of him?

308
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,382
I'm serious, if it was you, you would have thrown it at him.

309
00:28:44,115 --> 00:28:47,403
I mean there was all this dust, and moldy candy all over it.

310
00:28:48,002 --> 00:28:50,506
I don't see how so much could
stick on it in that short a time.

311
00:28:51,075 --> 00:28:53,226
I guess that's the power of otaku magic!

312
00:29:05,805 --> 00:29:10,730
Excuse me, but could you stop feeding the pigeons?

313
00:29:12,945 --> 00:29:14,000
I'm sorry.

314
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:20,329
But you know, there are girls that like guys like them.
It sort of stirrs a maturnal instinct in them.

315
00:29:20,431 --> 00:29:22,474
No way!!  Right Saori?

316
00:29:22,814 --> 00:29:24,462
Hm?  I like it.

317
00:29:24,887 --> 00:29:25,505
What??

318
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,070
This lunch, it's good.

319
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:31,132
Oh, the lunch.  I was worried there.

320
00:29:38,419 --> 00:29:41,756
Excuse me, but I believe
we talked on the phone just now.

321
00:29:42,312 --> 00:29:46,335
I heard you had a problem with one of our people?

322
00:29:46,633 --> 00:29:49,923
A problem.  Yeah, I guess it's a problem.

323
00:29:50,565 --> 00:29:51,759
Was it a mistake of some kind?

324
00:29:51,931 --> 00:29:52,748
Not exactly.

325
00:29:54,373 --> 00:30:02,308
There's a rumour going around that one of
your female staff is seeing our Personnel Managaer.

326
00:30:02,188 --> 00:30:02,916
Seeing?

327
00:30:03,291 --> 00:30:04,426
Yeah, they were shacking up.

328
00:30:05,021 --> 00:30:07,394
Oh.  They were shacking up.

329
00:30:08,028 --> 00:30:13,346
So yeah, I wanted you to see if this rumour was true.

330
00:30:14,035 --> 00:30:15,435
Whether they were shacking up or not?

331
00:30:15,734 --> 00:30:17,366
So take care of it, ok?

332
00:30:20,533 --> 00:30:23,251
So what did you want?
I have to get back to work.

333
00:30:24,642 --> 00:30:27,138
So Miss. Jinnkama.

334
00:30:27,841 --> 00:30:29,616
Are you shacking up
with the Personnel Manager here?

335
00:30:30,416 --> 00:30:35,743
What?
There're better ways of asking that, aren't there?

336
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,657
Well no, I couldn't think of anything else.

337
00:30:40,093 --> 00:30:42,228
You could have just asked if I
was sleeping with the Manager.

338
00:30:42,955 --> 00:30:45,649
Huh?  You slept with the manager?

339
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:48,194
You didn't know what it meant did you?

340
00:30:51,508 --> 00:30:52,047
I'm sorry.

341
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:54,027
I didn't sleep with him you know.

342
00:30:55,123 --> 00:30:56,298
Oh.  I'm relieved.

343
00:30:57,226 --> 00:30:57,947
But I can't stay here anymore.

344
00:30:59,175 --> 00:30:59,601
Why not?

345
00:31:01,098 --> 00:31:05,977
Isn't it obvious?  I can't work here like I used to with
these kinds of rumours going on about me.

346
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:07,807
That's true.

347
00:31:08,552 --> 00:31:12,023
It's supposed to be your job to fix these problems,
so why is it I'm telling you?

348
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,020
I'm sorry.

349
00:31:13,939 --> 00:31:17,982
I'm leaving here.  Find me another place.  Got it?

350
00:31:28,216 --> 00:31:29,918
Man I wish something good would happen.

351
00:31:35,584 --> 00:31:39,503
If you gave her your address, she'll send you a present.
That's what I think.

352
00:31:49,954 --> 00:31:52,162
Was there a package for me?

353
00:31:52,567 --> 00:31:53,777
Yeah, I left it in your room.

354
00:31:54,972 --> 00:31:55,421
Really?

355
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:56,859
It looked like it was from a woman.

356
00:31:57,385 --> 00:31:58,722
A woman?

357
00:32:13,102 --> 00:32:15,734
Yessss!!

358
00:32:21,563 --> 00:32:26,552
When I got home today,
there was a package waiting for me.

359
00:32:29,974 --> 00:32:30,767
No way.

360
00:32:31,129 --> 00:32:31,799
This is amazing.

361
00:32:32,215 --> 00:32:33,135
Come on what then?

362
00:32:33,526 --> 00:32:41,383
The sender was the older woman.
I knew it from the letter inside.

363
00:32:41,899 --> 00:32:44,953
Come on, don't disappoint us like that.

364
00:32:45,154 --> 00:32:51,918
It said, "From all of us women", but do you think
this means it's the end of all this?

365
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:56,112
Yup, game over.
There's no chance of a package from the younger one.

366
00:32:56,264 --> 00:33:00,286
Forget the younger one, but I think
the older women have something going for you.

367
00:33:00,704 --> 00:33:04,093
It was all a dream, young one.
You should return to reality ASAP.

368
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,749
That's true.  I let it all go to my head.

369
00:33:08,374 --> 00:33:14,849
I help the lady, she's indebted and gives me a gift,
then I get to go out with her.  It was too good to be true.

370
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:19,806
I finally came to my senses.

371
00:33:20,662 --> 00:33:24,811
It's true that we can't expect anything else to happen.
That's what I think.

372
00:33:24,812 --> 00:33:31,325
Make no mistake;
you were really something yesterday.

373
00:33:34,526 --> 00:33:38,620
You've definitely moved forward.
I got a little courage from what you did.

374
00:33:43,078 --> 00:33:43,516
Everyone...

375
00:33:53,627 --> 00:33:55,475
23rd Birthday

376
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:01,571
I turned 23 just now.

377
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:06,785
And I got live an amazing dream.

378
00:34:20,312 --> 00:34:26,097
And now I'll return to my everyday boring life...

379
00:34:44,328 --> 00:34:48,082
Oh my gosh.  You really worked hard on this didn't you?

380
00:34:48,703 --> 00:34:50,112
Well I really wanted this to be good.

381
00:34:50,927 --> 00:34:54,240
A birthday cake.  You guys, thanks so-

382
00:34:55,546 --> 00:34:57,866
Look at the time!  I'm going to be late.

383
00:34:58,501 --> 00:35:00,884
How late does your Mother think she's
going to be sleeping?

384
00:35:01,564 --> 00:35:02,106
What is it?

385
00:35:02,307 --> 00:35:04,787
Uh, th, that cake.  What it is for?

386
00:35:04,867 --> 00:35:10,574
It's been a year since Aoi and Shuuya started dating.
This is to celebrate.

387
00:35:12,499 --> 00:35:15,545
Didn't I tell you not to come down when I'm in the house?

388
00:35:17,585 --> 00:35:18,618
That's too cruel.

389
00:35:22,571 --> 00:35:29,662
Lowerling, take these documents to Future Soft.
They're the resumes of the new workers.

390
00:35:31,952 --> 00:35:35,580
Don't botch things up for me, you got it?

391
00:35:36,346 --> 00:35:36,767
I'm sorry.

392
00:35:37,472 --> 00:35:41,041
At the same time, take these to Jinkama Misuzu
who's quitting as of today.

393
00:35:42,495 --> 00:35:48,299
Look sharp, Yamada.  There's plenty
of people that can take your place you know.

394
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:04,318
What happened?

395
00:36:08,844 --> 00:36:09,942
Want me to get that for you?

396
00:36:10,403 --> 00:36:10,902
Can you really?

397
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:36,122
Pervert!  Peeping around in broad daylight!
Just because I'm a foreigner.  Seriously!

398
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:46,878
Oww!

399
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:53,321
Don't go around accepting things
you have no chance of doing!

400
00:36:55,415 --> 00:36:56,166
What, what!

401
00:36:59,514 --> 00:36:59,963
Idiot.

402
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,089
That's too cruel.

403
00:37:52,066 --> 00:37:53,872
[empty]  [empty]  [empty]

404
00:38:12,837 --> 00:38:14,478
Thank you very much.

405
00:38:16,654 --> 00:38:17,061
You're welcome.

406
00:38:50,123 --> 00:38:52,005
[We're sorry, but please use an alternate entrance]

407
00:38:54,424 --> 00:38:55,728
I don't believe this.

408
00:39:04,336 --> 00:39:07,554
What do you think you're doing there?

409
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,657
Shinnkama-san.

410
00:39:10,561 --> 00:39:12,155
Do you know how long I've been waiting?

411
00:39:12,787 --> 00:39:13,394
I'm so sorry.

412
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,085
Here.

413
00:39:19,445 --> 00:39:20,712
What is this?

414
00:39:23,757 --> 00:39:25,812
This is worthless like this!

415
00:39:26,939 --> 00:39:31,172
You're hopeless.  I don't believe
you can't even deliver documents properly.

416
00:39:34,913 --> 00:39:36,449
Do you even deserve to live?

417
00:39:39,337 --> 00:39:42,000
Do you think if you just stand there,
I'm going to forgive you?

418
00:39:45,246 --> 00:39:46,382
Do you have any backbone at all?

419
00:39:48,063 --> 00:39:50,702
Don't you have anything to say for yourself?

420
00:39:55,228 --> 00:39:58,475
Hey, hey, what are you crying for?

421
00:40:03,579 --> 00:40:07,946
It's my birthday today, and everything's going wrong.

422
00:40:08,545 --> 00:40:10,507
I didn't know anything about that.

423
00:41:15,965 --> 00:41:16,989
I said, don't touch anything.

424
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,333
You're disturbing the neighborhood just being here.

425
00:41:21,716 --> 00:41:22,371
Idiot.

426
00:41:22,978 --> 00:41:26,849
Look sharp, there's plenty of
people that can take your place.

427
00:41:27,423 --> 00:41:28,440
Do you even deserve to live?

428
00:43:44,095 --> 00:43:47,657
This is to thank you for what you did on the train.

429
00:43:48,272 --> 00:43:52,588
I was touched by your bravery.

430
00:43:53,291 --> 00:43:56,498
I hope any injuries you had are getting better.

431
00:44:09,811 --> 00:44:10,414
This is...

432
00:44:12,132 --> 00:44:14,103
Could it be?

433
00:44:19,046 --> 00:44:24,467
It's actually came!! This is amazing.

434
00:44:26,713 --> 00:44:32,183
What am I doing with something precious like this?

435
00:44:35,475 --> 00:44:36,989
I gotta tell everyone.

436
00:44:39,487 --> 00:44:40,275
Ii i i it's unbelievable.

437
00:44:40,797 --> 00:44:46,246
I got a package from the young lady on the
train, containing a gift and a thank you letter.

438
00:44:49,852 --> 00:44:51,033
What should I do?

439
00:44:52,176 --> 00:44:54,243
The gift came!

440
00:44:54,593 --> 00:44:55,081
It's a miracle.

441
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,175
Calm down and take a deep breath.

442
00:44:57,735 --> 00:44:59,333
I'll advise you.

443
00:45:01,388 --> 00:45:02,189
Requesting details.

444
00:45:07,051 --> 00:45:13,125
The package contained two tea cups, a cute envelope,
and a cute letter with cute writing on it.

445
00:45:16,739 --> 00:45:17,702
I think the letter smells good.

446
00:45:21,597 --> 00:45:25,317
It's no good, my face is getting all hot, and drftg&j

447
00:45:25,886 --> 00:45:26,661
I gotta calm down.

448
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,651
Calm down, you're just imagining that smell.

449
00:45:31,218 --> 00:45:34,474
Can you tell anything from the contents of the letter?

450
00:45:35,427 --> 00:45:39,281
It says "I was touched by your bravery.".

451
00:45:39,545 --> 00:45:42,887
Doesn't this sound too good to be true?
It sounds like he's just making things up.

452
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,929
You can't tell a lot from just that one line.

453
00:45:45,214 --> 00:45:46,775
If it was a delivery, did you get her telephone number too?

454
00:45:54,896 --> 00:45:58,959
H, hhher cell phone number!

455
00:46:02,842 --> 00:46:05,977
Th, th, the delivery slip had her cell phone number on it!

456
00:46:07,588 --> 00:46:11,839
Not her home, but her C E L L.  Woow.

457
00:46:11,667 --> 00:46:12,772
Why don't you give her a call?

458
00:46:13,256 --> 00:46:14,217
Don't take this guy seriously.

459
00:46:14,597 --> 00:46:15,342
Call her.

460
00:46:16,278 --> 00:46:20,440
This is crazy.  I gotta relax for a minute.

461
00:46:23,907 --> 00:46:28,688
Calling her is.  Impossible.

462
00:46:31,462 --> 00:46:35,803
There's no way I can call a girl up.

463
00:46:35,895 --> 00:46:39,247
Just type her number in.
You can think about what to say later.

464
00:46:39,399 --> 00:46:40,953
First, pick up your cell.

465
00:46:52,327 --> 00:46:57,687
It's no use.  People can't change that quickly.

466
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:00,423
Maybe there's another way.

467
00:47:00,629 --> 00:47:01,340
How about a letter?

468
00:47:01,644 --> 00:47:03,770
I emphatically agree!  You'll sound more keen that way.

469
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:07,720
It's late so wait until tomorrow before making any moves.

470
00:47:07,666 --> 00:47:09,556
Women don't like being called out of the blue.

471
00:47:10,049 --> 00:47:14,601
I'm a woman, but I wouldn't mind.  I'd feel
relieved that my package arrived properly.

472
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:15,762
I'd feel a sense of honesty.

473
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:29,423
It's late today.  How about tomorrow?

474
00:47:29,901 --> 00:47:32,348
Fool!  You should act when you can.

475
00:47:32,709 --> 00:47:35,029
What are your specs?  I'll advise you.

476
00:47:35,064 --> 00:47:37,971
I'm a regular anime otaku type guy.

477
00:47:38,701 --> 00:47:41,724
I'm 23 years old,
which is the number of years I haven't dated.

478
00:47:42,803 --> 00:47:46,628
I make 27-36K a year, and live with my parents.

479
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:50,466
I have no car, and look like your stereotypical otaku.

480
00:47:51,544 --> 00:47:53,592
Don't worry, we're all like that.

481
00:47:53,659 --> 00:47:54,844
Why don't you treat it like a thank you call.

482
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:56,900
I'm sure she won't mind.

483
00:48:10,056 --> 00:48:10,850
I can't.

484
00:48:13,367 --> 00:48:16,300
I'm holding my cell, but I can't dial her number.

485
00:48:17,092 --> 00:48:19,109
I need more courage than on the train.

486
00:48:19,683 --> 00:48:21,533
My hands are shaking and my face is hot.

487
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:23,320
My heart's pounding.

488
00:48:25,325 --> 00:48:29,666
This isn't just a thread topic anymore.
We're behind you on this one.

489
00:48:30,182 --> 00:48:31,933
Even I'm getting nervous.

490
00:48:32,629 --> 00:48:33,271
Me too.

491
00:48:33,622 --> 00:48:36,611
Everyone's hands shake the first time.
It was like that for me too.

492
00:48:36,924 --> 00:48:38,479
Come on, he's just making it up.

493
00:48:39,013 --> 00:48:39,981
You can buzz off.

494
00:48:40,004 --> 00:48:41,028
I'm cheering you on.

495
00:48:41,701 --> 00:48:45,586
Just remember.  The girl's alone, but you?

496
00:48:46,794 --> 00:48:51,656
You have all of us supporting you.  Don't forget that.

497
00:49:11,644 --> 00:49:12,992
Thanks so much everybody.

498
00:49:13,761 --> 00:49:21,540
I'm starting to cry thinking about your kindness,
and how weak I am.

499
00:49:23,798 --> 00:49:26,484
I want to change.

500
00:49:38,372 --> 00:49:40,123
You can do it, you can do it!!

501
00:49:52,165 --> 00:49:53,474
How about that letter?

502
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:02,904
With a letter, the chance of talking to her again is too low.

503
00:50:03,057 --> 00:50:07,564
If it's two cups, then she's interested in you.

504
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,095
It's standard as a gift.

505
00:50:09,551 --> 00:50:11,727
Do you know what brand cups they were?

506
00:50:20,801 --> 00:50:21,883
He ru mess?

507
00:50:23,563 --> 00:50:24,098
Har mess?

508
00:50:26,145 --> 00:50:26,695
Which is it?

509
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:35,477
It says on the cups that they're
H E R M E S

510
00:50:36,628 --> 00:50:37,629
I wonder what brand it is?

511
00:50:38,216 --> 00:50:40,247
What?  Hermes?  No way!  Hermes?!!

512
00:50:40,782 --> 00:50:43,575
Yes!  Yes!!

513
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:45,236
It's pronounced Ermess.

514
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:50,006
Not the one with Lala on it. Hehe.

515
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:52,710
Whoa, Hermes eh?  That's a rich lady we're talking about.

516
00:50:54,213 --> 00:50:57,661
EeeHermes?  That Hermes?

517
00:51:01,372 --> 00:51:05,820
That's the brand that makes the bags right?
Brand name cups...my hands are shaking.

518
00:51:07,262 --> 00:51:07,885
Hermes!

519
00:51:10,544 --> 00:51:14,694
I don't think she'd chose Hermes if she just wanted to thank you.
That's what I think.

520
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:17,201
Thinks are really heating up here!

521
00:51:17,667 --> 00:51:19,552
Call her, call her, call her!

522
00:51:19,967 --> 00:51:22,567
Make it a letter.  You'll never be able to speak properly.

523
00:51:22,964 --> 00:51:24,277
Call her.  Definitely call her.

524
00:51:24,761 --> 00:51:25,786
Definitely DON'T call her.

525
00:51:26,643 --> 00:51:29,560
It'll show you really appreciated the gift.
Give her a call.

526
00:51:29,895 --> 00:51:32,084
If you're going to call her, I'll be on standy to advise you.

527
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:36,699
After 11, it's couples hour.  How depressing for me.

528
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:39,365
Make up your mind already, and call her!

529
00:51:39,861 --> 00:51:41,866
It's too late already.  Give it up.

530
00:51:42,595 --> 00:51:47,091
In your position, what have you got to lose?!

531
00:51:57,801 --> 00:51:58,553
What should I do?

532
00:52:25,871 --> 00:52:30,248
The Train Man

533
00:52:31,937 --> 00:52:32,464
It's amazing.

534
00:52:34,685 --> 00:52:38,531
Dddensha Otoko (The Train Man).  Is that me?

535
00:52:46,148 --> 00:52:49,362
Everyone...  I...

536
00:52:52,594 --> 00:52:55,444
You can do it!

537
00:53:05,975 --> 00:53:07,695
I'll do what the next post says to do.

538
00:53:23,089 --> 00:53:23,816
Call her!!

539
00:53:27,544 --> 00:53:32,983
Please, Densha Otoko.  Change for our sake.

540
00:53:38,818 --> 00:53:40,504
731-Alias Densha Otoko

541
00:53:45,884 --> 00:53:47,356
I'm going to call her now.

542
00:54:00,699 --> 00:54:02,027
[yes]  [yes]     [yes]     [yes]    [yes]       [yes]

543
00:54:02,683 --> 00:54:03,907
YES!

544
00:54:12,496 --> 00:54:14,074
Go for it kid!!

545
00:54:30,997 --> 00:54:34,140
Hurry up and make dinner, stupid!
Do you want to get hit again?

546
00:54:37,762 --> 00:54:40,330
Shut up!  I'm not your house maid!

547
00:54:44,335 --> 00:54:45,047
I was able to say it too.

548
00:54:47,138 --> 00:54:50,321
_0_9_0_

549
00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:02,010
Hey.

550
00:55:03,332 --> 00:55:03,691
Yeah?

551
00:55:04,077 --> 00:55:05,857
Are you thinking about your future seriously?

552
00:55:08,625 --> 00:55:09,129
Marriage right?

553
00:55:11,538 --> 00:55:13,599
No need to worry, I'm thinking about it.

554
00:55:17,887 --> 00:55:19,743
_5_0_

555
00:55:27,317 --> 00:55:31,150
You can do it.   You're the best of us guys.  You're great!!

556
00:55:33,308 --> 00:55:33,762
Everyone.

557
00:55:51,356 --> 00:55:51,828
It's ringing.
