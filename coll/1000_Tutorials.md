During Operation Payback, I got this little 7ziped file, which was less than 2 MB in size. Even so, it contains literally 1000 tutorials in text format for anyone to read. Some of it is really old, others unneeded at this point in time, but there's a lot of cool stuff that we need to get out of it, like the Anarchist's Cookbook and the hacking guides. Help us out here by exporting and formatting the pages to be put here in this wiki.
