This article is about the Bibliotheca Anonoma itself.

## Installation and Editing

* [[Hosting]] - Want to host a mirror of the Bibliotheca Anonoma? Follow this guide and you'l have one up easily.
* [[Editing_This_Wiki]] - If you're mystified by how ikiwiki works and how to edit it, (it is a pretty unique wiki), never fear! Just read this guide and all will be fine and dandy.

## Design and Possible Modifications

* [[Help|help]] - details what needs to be done in this wiki.
* [[Fully_Decentralized_Wiki]] - A design specification for a fully distributed wiki, based on Ikiwiki, a Web of Trust, a DVCS, and a p2p layer for that DVCS. It's similar to what [[proj/Project_Mayhem]] suggests with [[proj/TYLER]]. The difference here is that we present and explore actual methods of making this wiki a reality, rather than simply focusing on the implications.

## Tools

*Stuff that we use to maintain the wiki. They need lots of work and attention.*

* [[Retext: Ikiwiki Mod|tools/retext-ikiwiki]] - If you're running Windows, but still want to edit the wiki with a comfy GUI while offline, use this Markdown reader in conjuction with a git clone of the whole wiki.
* [[Mediawiki2Markdown|tools/mediawiki2markdown]] - Our crappy little Mediawiki converting scripts. It's not perfect, and it causes a few problems with links, but it's the only thing we got.
