This operation is aimed at the overall disruption of 'shock jock' talk show host James Stannage and his allies.

Stannage is a late night radio show presenter, who just so happens to have his own [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Stannage Niggerpedia] entry.

Prone to bouts of unwarranted self importance and suffering massive amounts of rage live on air, it was long over due that Stannage caught the attention of Anon.

Stannage has a hatred for religion. He particularly holds a grudge against kykes as it was a comment made about kykes on air which cost him his 6 figure salary at his previous station [http://www.key103.co.uk/default.asp Key 103].

Throughout his 'glittering' career as a nigger with a microphone and a mouth as big as a watermelon. Stannage has made some mortal enemies. The last boss of Stannages enemies is none other than rival Liverpudlian talk show host [http://www.peteprice.com/ Pete Price].

It is therefore accepted that this overall operation is commanded and organized by none other than Major General Pete Price of the 101st Anon Divison, with funding given by his superior officers '[http://img80.imageshack.us/my.php?image=giefmoniezploxlx7.jpg The Jewish Overlords]'.

Born on the 22 February 1950, known as the voice of Manchester.

Started out as an [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Fail amateur actor] and secondary [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Pervert school teacher] and spent a few years in San Francisco studying drama.

It is widely accepted that Stannage is [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Faggot bi-sexual].

Stannage has two grown up sons, and two young [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Raep grandchildren], reconnaissance has revealed one is called Emily. His eldest son [http://www.facebook.com/s.php?k=100000080&id=508416583 Darren Stannage] is a Sports Journalist (currently working for [http://www.key103.co.uk/default.asp Key 103]) while his yonger son [http://www.facebook.com/s.php?k=100000080&id=551355128 Dominic Stannage] is also a radio presenter on Manchester Radio Online and a member of a [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Guitar_Hero rock band] in his spare time.

Some expert insiders suggest Stannage was once an ex-member of Anon, giving it up for 'radio' fame. Proof of such speculation comes from his repeated on air buffoonery, with jokes about the [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/manchester/4467160.stm dead], racism, advice on how to become an hero, jokes about dead chinese people, racist remarks, public expressions of 'liberal' child dating laws, and generally going out of his way to offend a lot of people i.e. branding past and present soldiers 'thick and ignorant'. Ofcom described Stannages show content as  "some of the most offensive material" it had ever heard, and listeners complained that the comments, made by presenter James Stannage, were offensive, racist, and incited racial hatred. These shenanigans cost his old station at least over 9000 Ugandan dollars (Â£140,000 ($280,000)) in fines.

The Bishop of Salford publicly condemned Stannage as a bad influence.

His 'theme tune' on his Key 103 station was [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Djj7jW6ny2M George Thoroughgoods - Bad to the bone].
